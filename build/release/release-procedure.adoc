= Release Procedure

== Projects and Artifacts
Following sections describe what projects are part of the OptaPlanner release procedure and their resulting
release artifacts.

=== OptaPlanner

* JAR files hosted on Maven Central
* https://download.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latestFinal[Distribution Zip]
available via a link on the optaplanner-website
* https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html[Documentation]
available via a link on the optaplanner-website
* XML Schema Definition files for both the https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/[Solver]
and the https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/benchmark/[Benchmark] available on the optaplanner-website

=== OptaPlanner Quickstarts

No build artifacts are required; as a result of the release, the `development` branch must be rebased onto
the `stable` branch and must point to the released final version of OptaPlanner.

=== OptaWeb Vehicle Routing

* https://www.optaplanner.org/download/download.html[Distribution Zip] available via a link on the optaplanner-website
* https://www.optaplanner.org/learn/documentation.html[Documentation] available via a link on the optaplanner-website

=== OptaPlanner Website
The website contains https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-website/blob/main/_config/pom.yml[links]
to the Distribution Zip files and documentation (see above). To update the documentation, and the Distribution Zip,
upload them to the `filemgmt.jboss.org` and then, open a PR changing the links.

For the OptaPlanner project, there is a https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/blob/main/build/release/upload_distribution.sh[script]
uploading the documentation and the Distribution Zip. The release pipeline calls the script and updates also
the links on the website. For Optaweb Vehicle Routing, the upload has to be done manually at this moment.

== Versioning

=== Project Version

The project uses https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] with a `.Final` suffix  for stable releases.
After a feature release MAJOR.MINOR.0.Final, the version on the `main` branch upgrades to MAJOR.MINOR+1.0-SNAPSHOT.
The next feature release is MAJOR.MINOR+1.0.Final.

As an example, the first version released by this procedure is going to be 8.0.0.Final. After the release,
the `main` branch upgrades to 8.1.0-SNAPSHOT. The next release is 8.1.0.Final.

=== Release Branches

Release branches are created for every feature release and named based on the released version by using the following convention:
Version MAJOR.MINOR.0.Final releases from a branch MAJOR.MINOR.x. After the release, this branch upgrades to MAJOR.MINOR.1-SNAPSHOT.

For example, the version 8.0.0.Final is released from a release branch 8.0.x, which is then upgraded to 8.0.1-SNAPSHOT version of the OptaPlanner.

At that moment, the branch is prepared for a patch release, if needed.

== Release Steps

This chapter describes steps required to release artifacts enlisted above, as well as other preliminary and
postliminary actions.

=== 1. Release the version in Jira

Navigate to the https://issues.redhat.com/projects/PLANNER?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page[Releases page in JIRA],
find the version to be released and pick “Release” from the Actions. Create a next version for OptaPlanner and release the current version but WITHOUT
release date.

=== 2. Create a new branch for OptaPlanner release

Run on Jenkins https://eng-jenkins-csb-business-automation.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/KIE/job/optaplanner/job/0-prepare-release-branch[0-prepare-release-branch]
to create a new branch where to release from. +
Most links in this document take the 8.27.x branch as an example!

=== 3. Update Drools

Since OptaPlanner is not released anymore as a part of the Kogito release pipeline the Drools version is not upgraded automatically. This has to be done by running
https://eng-jenkins-csb-business-automation.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/KIE/job/optaplanner/job/8.27.x/job/tools/job/update-drools-optaplanner/[update-drools-optaplanner]. +
IMPORTANT: this job should be triggered only if the artifacts of Drools version (as an example drools-bom) are already on https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/drools/drools-bom[Maven Central].
Also the Drools version has to be updated on OptaPlanner main branch running
https://eng-jenkins-csb-business-automation.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/KIE/job/optaplanner/job/main/job/tools/job/update-drools-optaplanner/[update-drools-optaplanner] on main branch.

=== 4. Release OptaPlanner

The OptaPlanner release pipeline can be triggered now based on the created new branch in step 2.
Run https://eng-jenkins-csb-business-automation.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/KIE/job/optaplanner/job/8.27.x/job/release/job/optaplanner-release[optaplanner-release].
The OptaPlanner release pipeline runs the https://eng-jenkins-csb-business-automation.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/KIE/job/optaplanner/job/8.27.x/job/release/job/optaplanner-deploy[optaplanner-deploy] job
which updates the project versions of OptaPlanner, Quickstarts and OptaWeb Vehicle Routing, builds these projects and deploys their artifacts to Nexus.
After this deployment step it promotes the projects. In this promote step PRs to upgrade the projects will be raised and merged as well as the tag created and pushed.

=== 5. OptaPlanner post release steps
Once OptaPlanner has been released and its artifacts are on Maven Central the release procedure can proceed
with https://eng-jenkins-csb-business-automation.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/KIE/job/optaplanner/job/8.27.x/job/release/job/optaplanner-post-release[optaplanner-post-release]. +
This job +

* resets https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts[Quickstarts] to stable branch
* uploads OptaPlanner distribution from https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts[Quickstarts]
* updates the https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-website[OptaPlanner website]
* updates OptaPlanner version in https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-benchmarks/blob/main/optaplanner-benchmarks/pom.xml#L21[kie-benchmarks]

=== 6. Set release date for OptaPlanner release into JIRA

Navigate to the https://issues.redhat.com/projects/PLANNER?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page[Releases page in JIRA],
find the already released and current version and edit it. Add the release date.
