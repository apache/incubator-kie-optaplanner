=== Definition of Done

To consider any individual ticket "Done", following requirements must be satisfied:

  . Every change must go through PR; source code of both the feature/bugfix and its tests have been reviewed.
  . Documentation (if applicable) exists and has been reviewed.
  . There is test coverage proving the feature works and tests are passing.

In order to avoid introducing unstable features, the PR will be merged only after these points have been fulfilled. For PRs contributed by community the core team will assist with making the functionality meet these conditions.
