== Quick development start

To build and run from source:

$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
$ cd optaplanner-examples
$ mvn exec:java
----

To develop with IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or NetBeans, open the root `pom.xml` as a new project
and configure a _Run/Debug configuration_ like this:

* Type: Application
* Main class: `org.optaplanner.examples.app.OptaPlannerExamplesApp`
* VM options: `-Xmx2G -server` (memory only needed when using the big datasets in the examples)
* Program arguments: (none)
* Working directory: `$MODULE_DIR$` (must resolve to optaplanner-examples directory)
* Use classpath of module: `optaplanner-examples`
