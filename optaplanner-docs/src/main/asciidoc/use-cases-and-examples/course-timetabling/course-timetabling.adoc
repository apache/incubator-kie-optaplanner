[[curriculumCourseProblemDescription]]
== Problem description

Schedule each lecture into a timeslot and into a room.

Hard constraints:

* Teacher conflict: A teacher must not have two lectures in the same period.
* Curriculum conflict: A curriculum must not have two lectures in the same period.
* Room occupancy: two lectures must not be in the same room in the same period.
* Unavailable period (specified per dataset): A specific lecture must not be assigned to a specific period.

Soft constraints:

* Room capacity: A room's capacity should not be less than the number of students in its lecture.
* Minimum working days: Lectures of the same course should be spread out into a minimum number of days.
* Curriculum compactness: Lectures belonging to the same curriculum should be adjacent to each other (so in consecutive periods).
* Room stability: Lectures of the same course should be assigned to the same room.

The problem is defined by http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/itc2007/curriculmcourse/course_curriculm_index.htm[the International Timetabling Competition 2007 track 3].
