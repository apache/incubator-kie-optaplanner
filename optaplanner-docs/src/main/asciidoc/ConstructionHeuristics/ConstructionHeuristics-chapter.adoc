[[constructionHeuristicsOverview]]
== Overview

A construction heuristic builds a pretty good initial solution in a finite length of time.
Its solution isn't always feasible, but it finds it fast so metaheuristics can finish the job.

Construction heuristics terminate automatically, so there's usually no need to configure a `Termination` on the construction heuristic phase specifically.


[[firstFit]]
== First Fit


[[firstFitAlgorithm]]
=== Algorithm Description

The First Fit algorithm cycles through all the planning entities (in default order), initializing 1 planning entity at a time.
It assigns the planning entity to the best available planning value, taking the already initialized planning entities into account.
It terminates when all planning entities have been initialized.
It never changes a planning entity after it has been assigned.

Notice that it starts with putting `Queen` A into row 0 (and never moving it later), which makes it impossible to reach the optimal solution.
Suffixing this construction heuristic with metaheuristics can remedy that.

[[firstFitDecreasing]]
== First Fit Decreasing


[[firstFitDecreasingAlgorithm]]
=== Algorithm Description

Like First Fit, but assigns the more difficult planning entities first, because they are less likely to fit in the leftovers.
So it sorts the planning entities on decreasing difficulty.

Requires the model to support <<planningEntityDifficulty,planning entity difficulty comparison>>.

[[weakestFit]]
== Weakest Fit


[[weakestFitAlgorithm]]
=== Algorithm Description

Like First Fit, but uses the weaker planning values first, because the strong planning values are more likely to be able to accommodate later planning entities.
So it sorts the planning values on increasing strength.

Requires the model to support <<planningValueStrength,planning value strength comparison>>.

[NOTE]

Do not presume that this algorithm has better results than First Fit.
That's often not the case.

[[weakestFitDecreasing]]
== Weakest Fit Decreasing


[[weakestFitDecreasingAlgorithm]]
=== Algorithm Description

Combines First Fit Decreasing and Weakest Fit.

Requires the model to support <<planningEntityDifficulty,planning entity difficulty comparison>>

[[strongestFit]]

[[strongestFitAlgorithm]]
=== Algorithm Description

Like First Fit, but uses the strong planning values first, because the strong planning values are more likely to have a lower soft cost to use.
So it sorts the planning values on decreasing strength.

Requires the model to support <<planningValueStrength,planning value strength comparison>>.

[[allocateEntityFromQueue]]
== Allocate Entity From Queue


[[allocateEntityFromQueueAlgorithm]]
=== Algorithm Description

Allocate Entity From Queue is a versatile, generic form of <<firstFit,First Fit>>, <<firstFitDecreasing,First Fit Decreasing>>, <<weakestFit,Weakest Fit>> and <<weakestFitDecreasing,Weakest Fit Decreasing>>.
It works like this:

. Put all entities in a queue.
. Assign the first entity (from that queue) to the best value.
. Repeat until all entities are assigned.


[[allocateEntityFromQueueConfiguration]]
=== Configuration

Simple configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    <constructionHeuristicType>ALLOCATE_ENTITY_FROM_QUEUE</constructionHeuristicType>
  </constructionHeuristic>
----

Verbose simple configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    <constructionHeuristicType>ALLOCATE_ENTITY_FROM_QUEUE</constructionHeuristicType>
    <entitySorterManner>DECREASING_DIFFICULTY_IF_AVAILABLE</entitySorterManner>
    <valueSorterManner>INCREASING_STRENGTH_IF_AVAILABLE</valueSorterManner>
  </constructionHeuristic>
----

The `entitySorterManner` options are:

* ``DECREASING_DIFFICULTY``: Initialize the more difficult planning entities first. This usually increases pruning (and therefore improves scalability). Requires the model to support <<planningEntityDifficulty,planning entity difficulty comparison>>.
* `DECREASING_DIFFICULTY_IF_AVAILABLE` (default): If the model supports <<planningEntityDifficulty,planning entity difficulty comparison>>, behave like ``DECREASING_DIFFICULTY``, else like ``NONE``.
* ``NONE``: Initialize the planning entities in original order.

The `valueSorterManner` options are:

* ``INCREASING_STRENGTH``: Evaluate the planning values in increasing strength. Requires the model to support <<planningValueStrength,planning value strength comparison>>.
* `INCREASING_STRENGTH_IF_AVAILABLE` (default): If the model supports <<planningValueStrength,planning value strength comparison>>, behave like ``INCREASING_STRENGTH``, else like ``NONE``.
* ``DECREASING_STRENGTH``: Evaluate the planning values in decreasing strength. Requires the model to support <<planningValueStrength,planning value strength comparison>>.
* ``DECREASING_STRENGTH_IF_AVAILABLE``: If the model supports <<planningValueStrength,planning value strength comparison>>, behave like ``DECREASING_STRENGTH``, else like ``NONE``.
* ``NONE``: Try the planning values in original order.

Advanced detailed configuration.
For example, a Weakest Fit Decreasing configuration for a single entity class with a single variable:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    <queuedEntityPlacer>
      <entitySelector id="placerEntitySelector">
        <cacheType>PHASE</cacheType>
        <selectionOrder>SORTED</selectionOrder>
        <sorterManner>DECREASING_DIFFICULTY</sorterManner>
      </entitySelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector mimicSelectorRef="placerEntitySelector"/>
        <valueSelector>
          <cacheType>PHASE</cacheType>
          <selectionOrder>SORTED</selectionOrder>
          <sorterManner>INCREASING_STRENGTH</sorterManner>
        </valueSelector>
      </changeMoveSelector>
    </queuedEntityPlacer>
  </constructionHeuristic>
----

Per step, the `QueuedEntityPlacer` selects 1 uninitialized entity from the `EntitySelector` and applies the winning `Move` (out of all the moves for that entity generated by the ``MoveSelector``).
The <<mimicSelection,mimic selection>> ensures that the winning `Move` changes (only) the selected entity.

To customize the entity or value sorting, see <<sortedSelection,sorted selection>>.
Other `Selector` customization (such as <<filteredSelection,filtering>> and <<limitedSelection,limiting>>) is supported too.


[[allocateEntityFromQueueMultipleVariables]]
=== Multiple Variables

There are 2 ways to deal with multiple variables, depending on how their ``ChangeMove``s are combined:

* Cartesian product of the ``ChangeMove``s (default): All variables of the selected entity are assigned together. Has far better results (especially for timetabling use cases).
* Sequential ``ChangeMove``s: One variable is assigned at a time. Scales much better, especially for 3 or more variables.

For example, presume a course scheduling example with 200 rooms and 40 periods.

This First Fit configuration for a single entity class with 2 variables, using a <<cartesianProductMoveSelector,cartesian product>> of their ``ChangeMove``s, will select 8000 moves per entity:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    <queuedEntityPlacer>
      <entitySelector id="placerEntitySelector">
        <cacheType>PHASE</cacheType>
      </entitySelector>
      <cartesianProductMoveSelector>
        <changeMoveSelector>
          <entitySelector mimicSelectorRef="placerEntitySelector"/>
          <valueSelector>
            <variableName>room</variableName>
          </valueSelector>
        </changeMoveSelector>
        <changeMoveSelector>
          <entitySelector mimicSelectorRef="placerEntitySelector"/>
          <valueSelector>
            <variableName>period</variableName>
          </valueSelector>
        </changeMoveSelector>
      </cartesianProductMoveSelector>
    </queuedEntityPlacer>
    ...
  </constructionHeuristic>
----

[WARNING]
====
With 3 variables of 1000 values each, a cartesian product selects 1000000000 values per entity, which will take far too long.
====

This First Fit configuration for a single entity class with 2 variables, using sequential ``ChangeMove``s, will select 240 moves per entity:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    <queuedEntityPlacer>
      <entitySelector id="placerEntitySelector">
        <cacheType>PHASE</cacheType>
      </entitySelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector mimicSelectorRef="placerEntitySelector"/>
        <valueSelector>
          <variableName>period</variableName>
        </valueSelector>
      </changeMoveSelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector mimicSelectorRef="placerEntitySelector"/>
        <valueSelector>
          <variableName>room</variableName>
        </valueSelector>
      </changeMoveSelector>
    </queuedEntityPlacer>
    ...
  </constructionHeuristic>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Especially for sequential ``ChangeMove``s, the order of the variables is important.
In the example above, it's better to select the period first (instead of the other way around), because there are more hard constraints that do not involve the room (for example: no teacher should teach 2 lectures at the same time). Let the <<benchmarker,Benchmarker>> guide you.
====

With 3 or more variables, it's possible to combine the cartesian product and sequential techniques:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    <queuedEntityPlacer>
      ...
      <cartesianProductMoveSelector>
        <changeMoveSelector>...</changeMoveSelector>
        <changeMoveSelector>...</changeMoveSelector>
      </cartesianProductMoveSelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>...</changeMoveSelector>
    </queuedEntityPlacer>
    ...
  </constructionHeuristic>
----


[[allocateEntityFromQueueMultipleEntityClasses]]
=== Multiple Entity Classes

The easiest way to deal with multiple entity classes is to run a separate construction heuristic for each entity class:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    <queuedEntityPlacer>
      <entitySelector id="placerEntitySelector">
        <cacheType>PHASE</cacheType>
        <entityClass>...DogEntity</entityClass>
      </entitySelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector mimicSelectorRef="placerEntitySelector"/>
      </changeMoveSelector>
    </queuedEntityPlacer>
    ...
  </constructionHeuristic>
  <constructionHeuristic>
    <queuedEntityPlacer>
      <entitySelector id="placerEntitySelector">
        <cacheType>PHASE</cacheType>
        <entityClass>...CatEntity</entityClass>
      </entitySelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector mimicSelectorRef="placerEntitySelector"/>
      </changeMoveSelector>
    </queuedEntityPlacer>
    ...
  </constructionHeuristic>
----


[[constructionHeuristicsPickEarlyType]]
=== Pick Early Type

There are several pick early types for Construction Heuristics:

* ``NEVER``: Evaluate all the selected moves to initialize the variable(s). This is the default if the <<initializingScoreTrend,InitializingScoreTrend>> is not ``ONLY_DOWN``.
+

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    ...
    <forager>
      <pickEarlyType>NEVER</pickEarlyType>
    </forager>
  </constructionHeuristic>
----
* ``FIRST_NON_DETERIORATING_SCORE``: Initialize the variable(s) with the first move that doesn't deteriorate the score, ignore the remaining selected moves. This is the default if the <<initializingScoreTrend,InitializingScoreTrend>> is ``ONLY_DOWN``.
+

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    ...
    <forager>
      <pickEarlyType>FIRST_NON_DETERIORATING_SCORE</pickEarlyType>
    </forager>
  </constructionHeuristic>
----
+

[NOTE]
====
If there are only negative constraints, but the <<initializingScoreTrend,InitializingScoreTrend>> is strictly not ``ONLY_DOWN``,
it can sometimes make sense to apply FIRST_NON_DETERIORATING_SCORE.
Use the <<benchmarker,Benchmarker>> to decide if the score quality loss is worth the time gain.
====
* ``FIRST_FEASIBLE_SCORE``: Initialize the variable(s) with the first move that has a feasible score.
+

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    ...
    <forager>
      <pickEarlyType>FIRST_FEASIBLE_SCORE</pickEarlyType>
    </forager>
  </constructionHeuristic>
----
+
If the <<initializingScoreTrend,InitializingScoreTrend>> is ``ONLY_DOWN``, use `FIRST_FEASIBLE_SCORE_OR_NON_DETERIORATING_HARD` instead, because that's faster without any disadvantages.
* ``FIRST_FEASIBLE_SCORE_OR_NON_DETERIORATING_HARD``: Initialize the variable(s) with the first move that doesn't deteriorate the feasibility of the score any further.
+

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
    ...
    <forager>
      <pickEarlyType>FIRST_FEASIBLE_SCORE_OR_NON_DETERIORATING_HARD</pickEarlyType>

[[cheapestInsertion]]
== Cheapest Insertion


[[cheapestInsertionAlgorithm]]
=== Algorithm Description

The Cheapest Insertion algorithm cycles through all the planning values for all the planning entities, initializing 1 planning entity at a time.
It assigns a planning entity to the best available planning value (out of all the planning entities and values), taking the already initialized planning entities into account.
It terminates when all planning entities have been initialized.
It never changes a planning entity after it has been assigned.

[[regretInsertion]]
== Regret Insertion


[[regretInsertionAlgorithm]]
=== Algorithm Description

The Regret Insertion algorithm behaves like the Cheapest Insertion algorithm.
It also cycles through all the planning values for all the planning entities, initializing 1 planning entity at a time.
But instead of picking the entity-value combination with the best score, it picks the entity which has the largest score loss between its best and second best value assignment.
It then assigns that entity to its best value, to avoid regretting not having done that.

Allocate From Pool is a versatile, generic form of <<cheapestInsertion,Cheapest Insertion>> and <<regretInsertion,Regret Insertion>>.
