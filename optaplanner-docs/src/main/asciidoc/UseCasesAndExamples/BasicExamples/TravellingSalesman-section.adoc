= Traveling Salesman (TSP - Traveling Salesman Problem)


[[tspProblemDescription]]
== Problem Description

Given a list of cities, find the shortest tour for a salesman that visits each city exactly once.

The problem is defined by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem[Wikipedia].
It is http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/[one of the most intensively studied problems] in computational mathematics.
Yet, in the real world, it is often only part of a planning problem, along with other constraints, such as employee shift rostering constraints.

[[tspProblemDifficulty]]
== Problem Difficulty

Despite TSP's simple definition, the problem is surprisingly hard to solve.
Because it is an NP-hard problem (like most planning problems), the optimal solution for a specific problem dataset can change a lot when that problem dataset is slightly altered:
