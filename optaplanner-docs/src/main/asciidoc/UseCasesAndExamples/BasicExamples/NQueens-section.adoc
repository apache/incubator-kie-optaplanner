[[nQueensProblemDescription]]
== Problem Description

Place _n_ queens on a _n_ sized chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other.
The most common _n_ queens puzzle is the eight queens puzzle, with __n = 8__:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/BasicExamples/nQueensScreenshot.png[align="center"]

Constraints:

* Use a chessboard of _n_ columns and _n_ rows.
* Place _n_ queens on the chessboard.
* No two queens can attack each other. A queen can attack any other queen on the same horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.

This documentation heavily uses the four queens puzzle as the primary example.

A proposed solution could be:

.A Wrong Solution for the Four Queens Puzzle
image::UseCasesAndExamples/BasicExamples/partiallySolvedNQueens04Explained.png[align="center"]

The above solution is wrong because queens `A1` and `B0` can attack each other (so can queens `B0` and ``D0``). Removing queen `B0` would respect the "no two queens can attack each other" constraint, but would break the "place _n_ queens" constraint.

Below is a correct solution:

.A Correct Solution for the Four Queens Puzzle

All the constraints have been met, so the solution is correct. 

Note that most _n_ queens puzzles have multiple correct solutions.
We will focus on finding a single correct solution for a given _n_, not on finding the number of possible correct solutions for a given _n_.

4queens   has   4 queens with a search space of    256.
8queens   has   8 queens with a search space of   10^7.
16queens  has  16 queens with a search space of  10^19.
32queens  has  32 queens with a search space of  10^48.
64queens  has  64 queens with a search space of 10^115.
256queens has 256 queens with a search space of 10^616.
----

The implementation of the _n_ queens example has not been optimized because it functions as a beginner example. Nevertheless, it can easily handle 64 queens.
With a few changes it has been shown to easily handle 5000 queens and more.


[[nQueensDomainModel]]
== Domain Model

This example uses the domain model to solve the four queens problem.

. *Creating a Domain Model* 
A good domain model will make it easier to understand and solve your planning problem.
+
This is the domain model for the _n_ queens example:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class Column {
    
    private int index;

    // ... getters and setters
}
----
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class Row {
    
    private int index;

    // ... getters and setters
}
----
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class Queen {
    
    private Column column;
    private Row row;

    public int getAscendingDiagonalIndex() {...}
    public int getDescendingDiagonalIndex() {...}

    // ... getters and setters
}
----


. *Calculating the Search Space.*
+
A `Queen` instance has a `Column` (for example: 0 is column A, 1 is column B, ...) and a `Row` (its row, for example: 0 is row 0, 1 is row 1, ...). 
+
The ascending diagonal line and the descending diagonal line can be calculated based on the column and the row.
+
The column and row indexes start from the upper left corner of the chessboard.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class NQueens {
    
    private int n;
    private List<Column> columnList;
    private List<Row> rowList;

    private List<Queen> queenList;

    private SimpleScore score;

    // ... getters and setters
}
----
+
. *Finding the Solution*
+
A single `NQueens` instance contains a list of all `Queen` instances.
It is the `Solution` implementation which will be supplied to, solved by, and retrieved from the Solver.

Notice that in the four queens example, NQueens's `getN()` method will always return four.

When two queens share the same column, row or diagonal line, such as ($$*$$) and ($$**$$), they can attack each other.
