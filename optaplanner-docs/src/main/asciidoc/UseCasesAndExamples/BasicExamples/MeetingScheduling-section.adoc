== Problem Description

Assign each meeting to a starting time and a room.
Meetings have different durations.

Hard constraints:

* Room conflict: two meetings must not use the same room at the same time.
* Required attendance: A person cannot have two required meetings at the same time.

Medium constraints:

* Preferred attendance: A person cannot have two preferred meetings at the same time, nor a preferred and a required meeting at the same time.

Soft constraints:

* Sooner rather than later: Schedule all meetings as soon as possible.
