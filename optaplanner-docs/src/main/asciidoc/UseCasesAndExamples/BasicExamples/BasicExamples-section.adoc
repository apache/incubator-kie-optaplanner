[[nQueens]]
== N Queens


[[nQueensProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Place _n_ queens on a _n_ sized chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other.
The most common _n_ queens puzzle is the eight queens puzzle, with __n = 8__:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/BasicExamples/nQueensScreenshot.png[align="center"]

Constraints:

* Use a chessboard of _n_ columns and _n_ rows.
* Place _n_ queens on the chessboard.
* No two queens can attack each other. A queen can attack any other queen on the same horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.

This documentation heavily uses the four queens puzzle as the primary example.

A proposed solution could be:

.A Wrong Solution for the Four Queens Puzzle
image::UseCasesAndExamples/BasicExamples/partiallySolvedNQueens04Explained.png[align="center"]

The above solution is wrong because queens `A1` and `B0` can attack each other (so can queens `B0` and ``D0``). Removing queen `B0` would respect the "no two queens can attack each other" constraint, but would break the "place _n_ queens" constraint.

Below is a correct solution:

.A Correct Solution for the Four Queens Puzzle
image::UseCasesAndExamples/BasicExamples/solvedNQueens04.png[align="center"]

All the constraints have been met, so the solution is correct. 

Note that most _n_ queens puzzles have multiple correct solutions.
We will focus on finding a single correct solution for a given _n_, not on finding the number of possible correct solutions for a given _n_.

The implementation of the _n_ queens example has not been optimized because it functions as a beginner example. Nevertheless, it can easily handle 64 queens.
With a few changes it has been shown to easily handle 5000 queens and more.


[[nQueensDomainModel]]
=== Domain Model

This example uses the domain model to solve the four queens problem.

. *Creating a Domain Model* 
A good domain model will make it easier to understand and solve your planning problem.
+
This is the domain model for the _n_ queens example:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class Column {
    
    private int index;

    // ... getters and setters
}
----
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class Row {
    
    private int index;

    // ... getters and setters
}
----
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class Queen {
    
    private Column column;
    private Row row;

    public int getAscendingDiagonalIndex() {...}
    public int getDescendingDiagonalIndex() {...}

    // ... getters and setters
}
----


. *Calculating the Search Space.*
+
A `Queen` instance has a `Column` (for example: 0 is column A, 1 is column B, ...) and a `Row` (its row, for example: 0 is row 0, 1 is row 1, ...). 
+
The ascending diagonal line and the descending diagonal line can be calculated based on the column and the row.
+
The column and row indexes start from the upper left corner of the chessboard.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class NQueens {
    
    private int n;
    private List<Column> columnList;
    private List<Row> rowList;

    private List<Queen> queenList;

    private SimpleScore score;

    // ... getters and setters
}
----
+
. *Finding the Solution*
+
A single `NQueens` instance contains a list of all `Queen` instances.
It is the `Solution` implementation which will be supplied to, solved by, and retrieved from the Solver.

Notice that in the four queens example, NQueens's `getN()` method will always return four.

[[tsp]]
== Traveling Salesman (TSP - Traveling Salesman Problem)


[[tspProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Given a list of cities, find the shortest tour for a salesman that visits each city exactly once.

The problem is defined by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem[Wikipedia].
It is http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/[one of the most intensively studied problems] in computational mathematics.
Yet, in the real world, it is often only part of a planning problem, along with other constraints, such as employee shift rostering constraints.

[[tspProblemDifficulty]]
=== Problem Difficulty

Despite TSP's simple definition, the problem is surprisingly hard to solve.
Because it is an NP-hard problem (like most planning problems), the optimal solution for a specific problem dataset can change a lot when that problem dataset is slightly altered:

[[dinnerParty]]
== Dinner Party


[[dinnerPartyProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Miss Manners is throwing another dinner party.

* This time she invited 144 guests and prepared 12 round tables with 12 seats each.
* Every guest should sit next to someone (left and right) of the opposite gender.
* And that neighbour should have at least one hobby in common with the guest.
* At every table, there should be two politicians, two doctors, two socialites, two coaches, two teachers and two programmers.
* And the two politicians, two doctors, two coaches and two programmers should not be the same kind at a table.

Drools Expert also has the normal Miss Manners example (which is much smaller) and employs an exhaustive heuristic to solve it.
Planner's implementation is far more scalable because it uses heuristics to find the best solution and Drools Expert to calculate the score of each solution.
