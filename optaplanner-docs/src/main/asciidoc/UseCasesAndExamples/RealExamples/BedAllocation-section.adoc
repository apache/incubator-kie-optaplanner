[[bedAllocationProblemDescription]]
== Problem Description

Assign each patient (that will come to the hospital) into a bed for each night that the patient will stay in the hospital.
Each bed belongs to a room and each room belongs to a department.
The arrival and departure dates of the patients is fixed: only a bed needs to be assigned for each night.

This problem features <<overconstrainedPlanning,overconstrained>> datasets.

Hard constraints:

* Two patients must not be assigned to the same bed in the same night. Weight: ``-1000hard * conflictNightCount``.
* A room can have a gender limitation: only females, only males, the same gender in the same night or no gender limitation at all. Weight: ``-50hard * nightCount``.
* A department can have a minimum or maximum age. Weight: ``-100hard * nightCount``.
* A patient can require a room with specific equipment(s). Weight: ``-50hard * nightCount``.

Medium constraints:

* Assign every patient to a bed, unless the dataset is overconstrained. Weight: ``-1medium * nightCount``.

Soft constraints:

* A patient can prefer a maximum room size, for example if he/she wants a single room. Weight: ``-8soft * nightCount``.
* A patient is best assigned to a department that specializes in his/her problem. Weight: ``-10soft * nightCount``.
* A patient is best assigned to a room that specializes in his/her problem. Weight: ``-20soft * nightCount``.
** That room speciality should be priority 1. Weight: ``-10soft * (priority - 1) * nightCount``.
* A patient can prefer a room with specific equipment(s). Weight: ``-20soft * nightCount``.

The problem is a variant on https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~wim.vancroonenburg/pas/[Kaho's Patient Scheduling] and the datasets come from real world hospitals.
