== Course Timetabling (ITC 2007 Track 3 - Curriculum Course Scheduling)


[[curriculumCourseProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Schedule each lecture into a timeslot and into a room.

Hard constraints:

* Teacher conflict: A teacher must not have two lectures in the same period.
* Curriculum conflict: A curriculum must not have two lectures in the same period.
* Room occupancy: two lectures must not be in the same room in the same period.
* Unavailable period (specified per dataset): A specific lecture must not be assigned to a specific period.

Soft constraints:

* Room capacity: A room's capacity should not be less than the number of students in its lecture.
* Minimum working days: Lectures of the same course should be spread out into a minimum number of days.
* Curriculum compactness: Lectures belonging to the same curriculum should be adjacent to each other (so in consecutive periods).
* Room stability: Lectures of the same course should be assigned to the same room.

The problem is defined by http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/itc2007/curriculmcourse/course_curriculm_index.htm[the International Timetabling Competition 2007 track 3].

[[machineReassignment]]
== Machine Reassignment (Google ROADEF 2012)


[[machineReassignmentProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Assign each process to a machine.
All processes already have an original (unoptimized) assignment.
Each process requires an amount of each resource (such as CPU, RAM, ...). This is a more complex version of the Cloud Balancing example.

Hard constraints:

* Maximum capacity: The maximum capacity for each resource for each machine must not be exceeded.
* Conflict: Processes of the same service must run on distinct machines.
* Spread: Processes of the same service must be spread out across locations.
* Dependency: The processes of a service depending on another service must run in the neighborhood of a process of the other service.
* Transient usage: Some resources are transient and count towards the maximum capacity of both the original machine as the newly assigned machine.

Soft constraints:

* Load: The safety capacity for each resource for each machine should not be exceeded.
* Balance: Leave room for future assignments by balancing the available resources on each machine.
* Process move cost: A process has a move cost.
* Service move cost: A service has a move cost.
* Machine move cost: Moving a process from machine A to machine B has another A-B specific move cost.

[[vehicleRouting]]
== Vehicle Routing


[[vehicleRoutingProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Using a fleet of vehicles, pick up the objects of each customer and bring them to the depot.
Each vehicle can service multiple customers, but it has a limited capacity.

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/vehicleRoutingUseCase.png[align="center"]

Besides the basic case (CVRP), there is also a variant with time windows (CVRPTW).

Hard constraints:

* Vehicle capacity: a vehicle cannot carry more items then its capacity.
* Time windows (only in CVRPTW):
** Travel time: Traveling from one location to another takes time.
** Customer service duration: a vehicle must stay at the customer for the length of the service duration.
** Customer ready time: a vehicle may arrive before the customer's ready time, but it must wait until the ready time before servicing.
** Customer due time: a vehicle must arrive on time, before the customer's due time.

Soft constraints:

* Total distance: minimize the total distance driven (fuel consumption) of all vehicles.

The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and its timewindowed variant (CVRPTW) are defined by http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/[the VRP web].

[[vehicleRoutingDomainModel]]
=== Domain Model

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/vehicleRoutingClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

The vehicle routing with timewindows domain model makes heavily use of <<shadowVariable,shadow variables>>.
This allows it to express its constraints more naturally, because properties such as `arrivalTime` and ``departureTime``, are directly available on the domain model.


[[roadDistancesInsteadOfAirDistances]]
=== Road Distances Instead of Air Distances

In the real world, vehicles cannot follow a straight line from location to location: they have to use roads and highways.
From a business point of view, this matters a lot:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/vehicleRoutingDistanceType.png[align="center"]

For the optimization algorithm, this does not matter much, as long as the distance between two points can be looked up (and are preferably precalculated). The road cost does not even need to be a distance, it can also be travel time, fuel cost, or a weighted function of those.
There are several technologies available to precalculate road costs, such as https://graphhopper.com/[GraphHopper] (embeddable, offline Java engine), http://open.mapquestapi.com/directions/#matrix[Open MapQuest] (web service) and https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/webservices/client-library[Google Maps Client API] (web service).

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/integrationWithRealMaps.png[align="center"]

There are also several technologies to render it, such as http://leafletjs.com[Leaflet] and https://developers.google.com/maps/[Google Maps for developers]: the `optaplanner-webexamples-*.war` has an example which demonstrates such rendering:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/vehicleRoutingLeafletAndGoogleMaps.png[align="center"]

It is even possible to render the actual road routes with GraphHopper or Google Map Directions, but because of route overlaps on highways, it can become harder to see the standstill order:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/vehicleRoutingGoogleMapsDirections.png[align="center"]

Take special care that the road costs between two points use the same optimization criteria as the one used in Planner.
For example, GraphHopper etc will by default return the fastest route, not the shortest route.
Don't use the km (or miles) distances of the fastest GPS routes to optimize the shortest trip in Planner: this leads to a suboptimal solution as shown below:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/roadDistanceTriangleInequality.png[align="center"]

Contrary to popular belief, most users do not want the shortest route: they want the fastest route instead.
They prefer highways over normal roads.
They prefer normal roads over dirt roads.
In the real world, the fastest and shortest route are rarely the same.


[[projectJobScheduling]]
== Project Job Scheduling


[[projectJobSchedulingProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Schedule all jobs in time and execution mode to minimize project delays.
Each job is part of a project.
A job can be executed in different ways: each way is an execution mode that implies a different duration but also different resource usages.
This is a form of flexible __job shop scheduling__.

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/projectJobSchedulingUseCase.png[align="center"]

Hard constraints:

* Job precedence: a job can only start when all its predecessor jobs are finished.
* Resource capacity: do not use more resources than available.
** Resources are local (shared between jobs of the same project) or global (shared between all jobs)
** Resource are renewable (capacity available per day) or nonrenewable (capacity available for all days)

Medium constraints:

* Total project delay: minimize the duration (makespan) of each project.

Soft constraints:

* Total makespan: minimize the duration of the whole multi-project schedule.

The problem is defined by http://gent.cs.kuleuven.be/mista2013challenge/[the MISTA 2013 challenge].

[[bedAllocation]]
== Hospital Bed Planning (PAS - Patient Admission Scheduling)


[[bedAllocationProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Assign each patient (that will come to the hospital) into a bed for each night that the patient will stay in the hospital.
Each bed belongs to a room and each room belongs to a department.
The arrival and departure dates of the patients is fixed: only a bed needs to be assigned for each night.

This problem features <<overconstrainedPlanning,overconstrained>> datasets.

image::UseCasesAndExamples/RealExamples/patientAdmissionScheduleUseCase.png[align="center"]

Hard constraints:

* Two patients must not be assigned to the same bed in the same night. Weight: ``-1000hard * conflictNightCount``.
* A room can have a gender limitation: only females, only males, the same gender in the same night or no gender limitation at all. Weight: ``-50hard * nightCount``.
* A department can have a minimum or maximum age. Weight: ``-100hard * nightCount``.
* A patient can require a room with specific equipment(s). Weight: ``-50hard * nightCount``.

Medium constraints:

* Assign every patient to a bed, unless the dataset is overconstrained. Weight: ``-1medium * nightCount``.

Soft constraints:

* A patient can prefer a maximum room size, for example if he/she wants a single room. Weight: ``-8soft * nightCount``.
* A patient is best assigned to a department that specializes in his/her problem. Weight: ``-10soft * nightCount``.
* A patient is best assigned to a room that specializes in his/her problem. Weight: ``-20soft * nightCount``.
** That room speciality should be priority 1. Weight: ``-10soft * (priority - 1) * nightCount``.
* A patient can prefer a room with specific equipment(s). Weight: ``-20soft * nightCount``.

The problem is a variant on https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~wim.vancroonenburg/pas/[Kaho's Patient Scheduling] and the datasets come from real world hospitals.
