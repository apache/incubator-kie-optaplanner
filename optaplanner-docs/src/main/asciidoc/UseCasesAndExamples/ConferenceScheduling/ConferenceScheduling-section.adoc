[[conferenceSchedulingProblemDescription]]
== Problem Description

Assign each conference talk to a timeslot and a room.
Timeslots can overlap. Read/write to/from an `*.xlsx` file that can be edited with LibreOffice or Excel too.

Hard constraints:

* Talk type of timeslot: The type of a talk must match the timeslot's talk type.
* Room unavailable timeslots: A talk's room must be available during the talk's timeslot.
* Room conflict: Two talks can't use the same room during overlapping timeslots.
* Speaker unavailable timeslots: Every talk's speaker must be available during the talk's timeslot.
* Speaker conflict: Two talks can't share a speaker during overlapping timeslots.
* Generic purpose timeslot and room tags
** Speaker required timeslot tag: If a speaker has a required timeslot tag, then all his/her talks must be assigned to a timeslot with that tag.
** Speaker prohibited timeslot tag: If a speaker has a prohibited timeslot tag, then all his/her talks cannot be assigned to a timeslot with that tag.
** Talk required timeslot tag: If a talk has a required timeslot tag, then it must be assigned to a timeslot with that tag.
** Talk prohibited timeslot tag: If a talk has a prohibited timeslot tag, then it cannot be assigned to a timeslot with that tag.
** Speaker required room tag: If a speaker has a required room tag, then all his/her talks must be assigned to a room with that tag.
** Speaker prohibited room tag: If a speaker has a prohibited room tag, then all his/her talks cannot be assigned to a room with that tag.
** Talk required room tag: If a talk has a required room tag, then it must be assigned to a room with that tag.
** Talk prohibited room tag: If a talk has a prohibited room tag, then it cannot be assigned to a room with that tag.
* Talk mutually-exclusive-talks tag: Talks that share such a tag must not be scheduled in overlapping timeslots.
* Talk prerequisite talks: A talk must be scheduled after all its prerequisite talks.

Soft constraints:

* Theme track conflict: Minimize the number of talks that share a same theme tag during overlapping timeslots.
* Sector conflict: Minimize the number of talks that share a same sector tag during overlapping timeslots.
* Content audience level flow violation: For every content tag, schedule the introductory talks before the advanced talks.
* Audience level diversity: For every timeslot, maximize the number of talks with a different audience level.
* Language diversity: For every timeslot, maximize the number of talks with a different language.
* Generic purpose timeslot and room tags
** Speaker preferred timeslot tag: If a speaker has a preferred timeslot tag, then all his/her talks should be assigned to a timeslot with that tag.
** Speaker undesired timeslot tag: If a speaker has a undesired timeslot tag, then all his/her talks should not be assigned to a timeslot with that tag.
** Talk preferred timeslot tag: If a talk has a preferred timeslot tag, then it should be assigned to a timeslot with that tag.
** Talk undesired timeslot tag: If a talk has a undesired timeslot tag, then it should not be assigned to a timeslot with that tag.
** Speaker preferred room tag: If a speaker has a preferred room tag, then all his/her talks should be assigned to a room with that tag.
** Speaker undesired room tag: If a speaker has a undesired room tag, then all his/her talks should not be assigned to a room with that tag.
** Talk preferred room tag: If a talk has a preferred room tag, then it should be assigned to a room with that tag.
** Talk undesired room tag: If a talk has a undesired room tag, then it should not be assigned to a room with that tag.
* Same day talks: All talks that share a same theme tag or content tag should be scheduled in the minimum number of days
(ideally in the same day).
