[[examinationProblemDescription]]
== Problem description

Schedule each exam into a period and into a room.
Multiple exams can share the same room during the same period.

image::UseCasesAndExamples/ExamTimetabling/examinationTimetablingUseCase.png[align="center"]

Hard constraints:

* Exam conflict: two exams that share students must not occur in the same period.
* Room capacity: A room's seating capacity must suffice at all times.
* Period duration: A period's duration must suffice for all of its exams.
* Period related hard constraints (specified per dataset):
** Coincidence: two specified exams must use the same period (but possibly another room).
** Exclusion: two specified exams must not use the same period.
** After: A specified exam must occur in a period after another specified exam's period.
* Room related hard constraints (specified per dataset):
** Exclusive: one specified exam should not have to share its room with any other exam.

Soft constraints (each of which has a parametrized penalty):

* The same student should not have two exams in a row.
* The same student should not have two exams on the same day.
* Period spread: two exams that share students should be a number of periods apart.
* Mixed durations: two exams that share a room should not have different durations.
* Front load: Large exams should be scheduled earlier in the schedule.
* Period penalty (specified per dataset): Some periods have a penalty when used.
* Room penalty (specified per dataset): Some rooms have a penalty when used.

It uses large test data sets of real-life universities.

The problem is defined by http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/itc2007/examtrack/exam_track_index.htm[the International Timetabling Competition 2007 track 1].
Geoffrey De Smet finished 4th in that competition with a very early version of OptaPlanner.
Many improvements have been made since then.

[[examinationDomainModel]]
== Domain model

Below you can see the main examination domain classes:

.Examination Domain Class Diagram
image::UseCasesAndExamples/ExamTimetabling/examinationDomainDiagram.png[align="center"]

Notice that we've split up the exam concept into an `Exam` class and a `Topic` class.
The `Exam` instances change during solving (this is the planning entity class), when their period or room property changes.
The ``Topic``, `Period` and `Room` instances never change during solving (these are problem facts, just like some other classes).
