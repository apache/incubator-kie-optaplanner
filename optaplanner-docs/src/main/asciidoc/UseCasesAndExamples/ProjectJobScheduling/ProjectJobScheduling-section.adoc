[[projectJobSchedulingProblemDescription]]
== Problem description

Schedule all jobs in time and execution mode to minimize project delays.
Each job is part of a project.
A job can be executed in different ways: each way is an execution mode that implies a different duration but also different resource usages.
This is a form of flexible __job shop scheduling__.

Hard constraints:

* Job precedence: a job can only start when all its predecessor jobs are finished.
* Resource capacity: do not use more resources than available.
** Resources are local (shared between jobs of the same project) or global (shared between all jobs)
** Resource are renewable (capacity available per day) or nonrenewable (capacity available for all days)

Medium constraints:

* Total project delay: minimize the duration (makespan) of each project.

Soft constraints:

* Total makespan: minimize the duration of the whole multi-project schedule.
