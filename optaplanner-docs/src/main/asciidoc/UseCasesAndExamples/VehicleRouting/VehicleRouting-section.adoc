[[vehicleRoutingProblemDescription]]
== Problem Description

Using a fleet of vehicles, pick up the objects of each customer and bring them to the depot.
Each vehicle can service multiple customers, but it has a limited capacity.

image::UseCasesAndExamples/VehicleRouting/vehicleRoutingUseCase.png[align="center"]

Besides the basic case (CVRP), there is also a variant with time windows (CVRPTW).

Hard constraints:

* Vehicle capacity: a vehicle cannot carry more items then its capacity.
* Time windows (only in CVRPTW):
** Travel time: Traveling from one location to another takes time.
** Customer service duration: a vehicle must stay at the customer for the length of the service duration.
** Customer ready time: a vehicle may arrive before the customer's ready time, but it must wait until the ready time before servicing.
** Customer due time: a vehicle must arrive on time, before the customer's due time.

Soft constraints:

* Total distance: minimize the total distance driven (fuel consumption) of all vehicles.

The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and its timewindowed variant (CVRPTW) are defined by http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/[the VRP web].

[[vehicleRoutingDomainModel]]
== Domain Model

image::UseCasesAndExamples/VehicleRouting/vehicleRoutingClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

The vehicle routing with timewindows domain model makes heavily use of <<shadowVariable,shadow variables>>.
This allows it to express its constraints more naturally, because properties such as `arrivalTime` and ``departureTime``, are directly available on the domain model.


[[roadDistancesInsteadOfAirDistances]]
=== Road Distances Instead of Air Distances

In the real world, vehicles cannot follow a straight line from location to location: they have to use roads and highways.
From a business point of view, this matters a lot:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/VehicleRouting/vehicleRoutingDistanceType.png[align="center"]

For the optimization algorithm, this does not matter much, as long as the distance between two points can be looked up (and are preferably precalculated). The road cost does not even need to be a distance, it can also be travel time, fuel cost, or a weighted function of those.
There are several technologies available to precalculate road costs, such as https://graphhopper.com/[GraphHopper] (embeddable, offline Java engine), http://open.mapquestapi.com/directions/#matrix[Open MapQuest] (web service) and https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/webservices/client-library[Google Maps Client API] (web service).

image::UseCasesAndExamples/VehicleRouting/integrationWithRealMaps.png[align="center"]

There are also several technologies to render it, such as http://leafletjs.com[Leaflet] and https://developers.google.com/maps/[Google Maps for developers]. The https://github.com/kiegroup/optaweb-vehicle-routing[OptaWeb Vehicle Routing project] has an example which demonstrates such rendering:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/VehicleRouting/vehicleRoutingLeafletAndGoogleMaps.png[align="center"]

It is even possible to render the actual road routes with GraphHopper or Google Map Directions, but because of route overlaps on highways, it can become harder to see the standstill order:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/VehicleRouting/vehicleRoutingGoogleMapsDirections.png[align="center"]

Take special care that the road costs between two points use the same optimization criteria as the one used in Planner.
For example, GraphHopper etc will by default return the fastest route, not the shortest route.
Don't use the km (or miles) distances of the fastest GPS routes to optimize the shortest trip in Planner: this leads to a suboptimal solution as shown below:

image::UseCasesAndExamples/VehicleRouting/roadDistanceTriangleInequality.png[align="center"]

Contrary to popular belief, most users do not want the shortest route: they want the fastest route instead.
They prefer highways over normal roads.
They prefer normal roads over dirt roads.
In the real world, the fastest and shortest route are rarely the same.
