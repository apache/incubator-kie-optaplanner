[[cheapTimeSchedulingProblemDescription]]
== Problem Description

Schedule all tasks in time and on a machine to minimize power cost.
Power prices differs in time.
This is a form of __job shop scheduling__.

Hard constraints:

* Start time limits: each task must start between its earliest start and latest start limit.
* Maximum capacity: the maximum capacity for each resource for each machine must not be exceeded.
* Startup and shutdown: each machine must be active in the periods during which it has assigned tasks. Between tasks it is allowed to be idle to avoid startup and shutdown costs.

Medium constraints:

* Power cost: minimize the total power cost of the whole schedule.
** Machine power cost: Each active or idle machine consumes power, which infers a power cost (depending on the power price during that time).
** Task power cost: Each task consumes power too, which infers a power cost (depending on the power price during its time).
** Machine startup and shutdown cost: Every time a machine starts up or shuts down, an extra cost is inflicted.

Soft constraints (addendum to the original problem definition):

* Start early: prefer starting a task sooner rather than later.
