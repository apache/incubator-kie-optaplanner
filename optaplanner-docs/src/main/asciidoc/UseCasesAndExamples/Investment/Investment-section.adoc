[[investmentProblemDescription]]
== Problem Description

Decide the relative quantity to invest in each asset class.

Hard constraints:

* Risk maximum: the total standard deviation must not be higher than the standard deviation maximum.
** Total standard deviation calculation takes asset class correlations into account by applying https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory[Markowitz Portfolio Theory].
* Region maximum: Each region has a quantity maximum.
* Sector maximum: Each sector has a quantity maximum.

Soft constraints:

* Maximize expected return.
