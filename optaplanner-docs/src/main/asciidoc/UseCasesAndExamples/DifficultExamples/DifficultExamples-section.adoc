== Exam Timetabling (ITC 2007 track 1 - Examination)


[[examinationProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Schedule each exam into a period and into a room.
Multiple exams can share the same room during the same period.

image::UseCasesAndExamples/DifficultExamples/examinationTimetablingUseCase.png[align="center"]

Hard constraints:

* Exam conflict: two exams that share students must not occur in the same period.
* Room capacity: A room's seating capacity must suffice at all times.
* Period duration: A period's duration must suffice for all of its exams.
* Period related hard constraints (specified per dataset):
** Coincidence: two specified exams must use the same period (but possibly another room).
** Exclusion: two specified exams must not use the same period.
** After: A specified exam must occur in a period after another specified exam's period.
* Room related hard constraints (specified per dataset):
** Exclusive: one specified exam should not have to share its room with any other exam.

Soft constraints (each of which has a parametrized penalty):

* The same student should not have two exams in a row.
* The same student should not have two exams on the same day.
* Period spread: two exams that share students should be a number of periods apart.
* Mixed durations: two exams that share a room should not have different durations.
* Front load: Large exams should be scheduled earlier in the schedule.
* Period penalty (specified per dataset): Some periods have a penalty when used.
* Room penalty (specified per dataset): Some rooms have a penalty when used.

It uses large test data sets of real-life universities.

The problem is defined by http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/itc2007/examtrack/exam_track_index.htm[the International Timetabling Competition 2007 track 1].
Geoffrey De Smet finished 4th in that competition with a very early version of Planner.
Many improvements have been made since then.

[[examinationDomainModel]]
=== Domain Model

Below you can see the main examination domain classes:

.Examination Domain Class Diagram
image::UseCasesAndExamples/DifficultExamples/examinationDomainDiagram.png[align="center"]

Notice that we've split up the exam concept into an `Exam` class and a `Topic` class.
The `Exam` instances change during solving (this is the planning entity class), when their period or room property changes.
The ``Topic``, `Period` and `Room` instances never change during solving (these are problem facts, just like some other classes).

== Employee Rostering (INRC 2010 - Nurse Rostering)


[[employeeRosteringProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

For each shift, assign a nurse to work that shift.

image::UseCasesAndExamples/DifficultExamples/employeeShiftRosteringUseCase.png[align="center"]

Hard constraints:

* *No unassigned shifts* (built-in): Every shift need to be assigned to an employee.
* **Shift conflict**: An employee can have only one shift per day.

Soft constraints:

* Contract obligations. The business frequently violates these, so they decided to define these as soft constraints instead of hard constraints.
** **Minimum and maximum assignments**: Each employee needs to work more than x shifts and less than y shifts (depending on their contract).
** **Minimum and maximum consecutive working days**: Each employee needs to work between x and y days in a row (depending on their contract).
** **Minimum and maximum consecutive free days**: Each employee needs to be free between x and y days in a row (depending on their contract).
** **Minimum and maximum consecutive working weekends**: Each employee needs to work between x and y weekends in a row (depending on their contract).
** **Complete weekends**: Each employee needs to work every day in a weekend or not at all.
** **Identical shift types during weekend**: Each weekend shift for the same weekend of the same employee must be the same shift type.
** **Unwanted patterns**: A combination of unwanted shift types in a row. For example: a late shift followed by an early shift followed by a late shift.
* Employee wishes:
** **Day on request**: An employee wants to work on a specific day.
** **Day off request**: An employee does not want to work on a specific day.
** **Shift on request**: An employee wants to be assigned to a specific shift.
** **Shift off request**: An employee does not want to be assigned to a specific shift.
* **Alternative skill**: An employee assigned to a skill should have a proficiency in every skill required by that shift.

* No repeaters: no two consecutive matches of the same two opposing teams.

Soft constraints:

* Minimize the total distance traveled by all teams.

[[cheapTimeScheduling]]
== Cheap Time Scheduling


[[cheapTimeSchedulingProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Schedule all tasks in time and on a machine to minimize power cost.
Power prices differs in time.
This is a form of __job shop scheduling__.

Hard constraints:

* Start time limits: each task must start between its earliest start and latest start limit.
* Maximum capacity: the maximum capacity for each resource for each machine must not be exceeded.
* Startup and shutdown: each machine must be active in the periods during which it has assigned tasks. Between tasks it is allowed to be idle to avoid startup and shutdown costs.

Medium constraints:

* Power cost: minimize the total power cost of the whole schedule.
** Machine power cost: Each active or idle machine consumes power, which infers a power cost (depending on the power price during that time).
** Task power cost: Each task consumes power too, which infers a power cost (depending on the power price during its time).
** Machine startup and shutdown cost: Every time a machine starts up or shuts down, an extra cost is inflicted.

Soft constraints (addendum to the original problem definition):

* Start early: prefer starting a task sooner rather than later.

The problem is defined by http://iconchallenge.insight-centre.org/[the ICON challenge].

== Investment asset class allocation (portfolio optimization)


[[investmentProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Decide the relative quantity to invest in each asset class.

Hard constraints:

* Risk maximum: the total standard deviation must not be higher than the standard deviation maximum.
** Total standard deviation calculation takes asset class correlations into account by applying https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory[Markowitz Portfolio Theory].
* Region maximum: Each region has a quantity maximum.
* Sector maximum: Each sector has a quantity maximum.

Soft constraints:

* Maximize expected return.
