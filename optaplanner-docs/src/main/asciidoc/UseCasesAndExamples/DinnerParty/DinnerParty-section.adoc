== Problem Description

Miss Manners is throwing another dinner party.

* This time she invited 144 guests and prepared 12 round tables with 12 seats each.
* Every guest should sit next to someone (left and right) of the opposite gender.
* And that neighbour should have at least one hobby in common with the guest.
* At every table, there should be two politicians, two doctors, two socialites, two coaches, two teachers and two programmers.
* And the two politicians, two doctors, two coaches and two programmers should not be the same kind at a table.

Drools Expert also has the normal Miss Manners example (which is much smaller) and employs an exhaustive heuristic to solve it.
Planner's implementation is far more scalable because it uses heuristics to find the best solution and Drools Expert to calculate the score of each solution.
