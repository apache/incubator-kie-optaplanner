[[cloudBalancingDomainModelDesign]]
== Domain Model Design

Using a <<domainModelingGuide,domain model>> helps determine which classes are planning entities and which of their properties are planning variables. It also helps to simplify contraints, improve performance, and increase flexibility for future needs. 

. Draw a class diagram of your domain model. 
. Normalize it to remove duplicate data.
. Write down some sample instances for each class. 

* ``Computer``: represents a computer with certain hardware and maintenance costs. 
+
In this example, the sample instances for the `Computer` class are: `cpuPower`, `memory`, `networkBandwidth`, `cost`. 
* ``Process``: represents a process with a demand. Needs to be assigned to a `Computer` by Planner. 
+
Sample instances for ``Process`` are: `requiredCpuPower`, `requiredMemory`, and `requiredNetworkBandwidth`.
* ``CloudBalance``: represents a problem. Contains every `Computer` and `Process` for a certain data set. 
+
The sample instance for `CloudBalance` is `score`.

. Determine which relationships (or fields) change during planning.

* Planning entity: the class (or classes) that changes during solving. In this example, it is the class ``Process``.
* Planning variable: the property (or properties) of a planning entity class that changes during solving. In this example, it is the property `computer` on the class ``Process``.
* Planning solution: the class that represents a data set and contains all planning entities. In this example that is the class ``CloudBalance``.

In the UML class diagram below, the Planner concepts are already annotated:

== Domain Model Implementation


[[cloudBalancingClassComputer]]
=== The `Computer` Class

The `Computer` class is a POJO (Plain Old Java Object). Usually, you will have more of this kind of classes with input data.

.CloudComputer.java
====
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class CloudComputer ... {

    private int cpuPower;
    private int memory;
    private int networkBandwidth;
    private int cost;

    ... // getters
}
----
====


[[cloudBalancingClassProcess]]
=== The `Process` Class

The `Process` class is particularly important. It is the class that is modified during solving.

We need to tell Planner that it can change the property ``computer``. To do this:
. Annotate the class with `@PlanningEntity`.
. Annotate the getter `getComputer()` with ``@PlanningVariable``.

Of course, the property `computer` needs a setter too, so Planner can change it during solving.

.CloudProcess.java
====
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningEntity(...)
public class CloudProcess ... {

    private int requiredCpuPower;
    private int requiredMemory;
    private int requiredNetworkBandwidth;

    private CloudComputer computer;

    ... // getters

    @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = {"computerRange"})
    public CloudComputer getComputer() {
        return computer;
    }

    public void setComputer(CloudComputer computer) {
        computer = computer;
    }

    // ************************************************************************
    // Complex methods
    // ************************************************************************

    ...

}
----
====

* Planner needs to know which values it can choose from to assign to the property ``computer``. Those values are retrieved from the method `CloudBalance.getComputerList()` on the planning solution, which returns a list of all computers in the current data set.

* The ``@PlanningVariable``'s `valueRangeProviderRefs` parameter on `CloudProcess.getComputer()` needs to match with the ``@ValueRangeProvider``'s `id` on CloudBalance.getComputerList().

[NOTE]
====
Instead of getter annotations, it is also possible to use <<annotationAlternatives,field annotations>>.
====


[[cloudBalancingClassCloudBalance]]
=== The `CloudBalance` Class

The `CloudBalance` class has a [path]_@PlanningSolution_
 annotation.
* It holds a list of all computers and processes.
* It represents both the planning problem and (if it's initialized) the planning solution.

. Planner needs to retrieve the collection of processes that it can change, therefore we annotate the getter `getProcessList()` with ``@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty``.

. The `CloudBalance` class also has a `@PlanningScore` annotated property ``score``, which is the `Score` of that solution in its current state.
Planner automatically updates it when it calculates a `Score` for a solution instance and therefore it needs a setter.

. Especially for score calculation with Drools, the property `computerList` needs to be annotated with a `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` so the computers are known to it.

.CloudBalance.java
====
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance ... {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;

    private List<CloudProcess> processList;

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {
        return computerList;
    }

    @PlanningEntityCollectionProperty
    public List<CloudProcess> getProcessList() {
        return processList;
    }

    @PlanningScore
    public HardSoftScore getScore() {
        return score;
    }

    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {
        this.score = score;
    }

    ...
}
