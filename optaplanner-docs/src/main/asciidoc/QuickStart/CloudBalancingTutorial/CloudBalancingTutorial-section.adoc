[[cloudBalancingProblemDescription]]
== Problem Description

Suppose your company owns a number of cloud computers and needs to run a number of processes on those computers.
Assign each process to a computer.

The following hard constraints must be fulfilled:

* Every computer must be able to handle the minimum hardware requirements of the sum of its processes:
** **CPU capacity**: The CPU power of a computer must be at least the sum of the CPU power required by the processes assigned to that computer.
** **Memory capacity**: The RAM memory of a computer must be at least the sum of the RAM memory required by the processes assigned to that computer.
** **Network capacity**: The network bandwidth of a computer must be at least the sum of the network bandwidth required by the processes assigned to that computer.

The following soft constraints should be optimized:

* Each computer that has one or more processes assigned, incurs a maintenance cost (which is fixed per computer).
** **Cost**: Minimize the total maintenance cost.

This problem is a form of __bin packing__.
The following is a simplified example, in which we assign four processes to two computers with two constraints (CPU and RAM) with a simple algorithm:

The simple algorithm used here is the _First Fit Decreasing_ algorithm, which assigns the bigger processes first and assigns the smaller processes to the remaining space.
As you can see, it is not optimal, as it does not leave enough room to assign the yellow process ``D``.

Planner does find the more optimal solution by using additional, smarter algorithms.
It also scales: both in data (more processes, more computers) and constraints (more hardware requirements, other constraints).
So let's see how Planner can be used in this scenario.

Here's an executive summary of this example and <<machineReassignment,an advanced implementation with more constraints>>:
