Now that this simple example works, you can try going further.
For example, you can enrich the domain model and add extra constraints such as these:

* Each `Process` belongs to a ``Service``. A computer might crash, so processes running the same service must be assigned to different computers.
* Each `Computer` is located in a ``Building``. A building might burn down, so processes of the same services should (or must) be assigned to computers in different buildings.
