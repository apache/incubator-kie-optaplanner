[[cloudBalancingProblemDescription]]
=== Problem Description

Suppose your company owns a number of cloud computers and needs to run a number of processes on those computers.
Assign each process to a computer.

The following hard constraints must be fulfilled:

* Every computer must be able to handle the minimum hardware requirements of the sum of its processes:
** **CPU capacity**: The CPU power of a computer must be at least the sum of the CPU power required by the processes assigned to that computer.
** **Memory capacity**: The RAM memory of a computer must be at least the sum of the RAM memory required by the processes assigned to that computer.
** **Network capacity**: The network bandwidth of a computer must be at least the sum of the network bandwidth required by the processes assigned to that computer.

The following soft constraints should be optimized:

* Each computer that has one or more processes assigned, incurs a maintenance cost (which is fixed per computer).
** **Cost**: Minimize the total maintenance cost.

This problem is a form of __bin packing__.
The following is a simplified example, in which we assign four processes to two computers with two constraints (CPU and RAM) with a simple algorithm:

image::Chapter-Quick_start/cloudBalanceUseCase.png[align="center"]

The simple algorithm used here is the _First Fit Decreasing_ algorithm, which assigns the bigger processes first and assigns the smaller processes to the remaining space.
As you can see, it is not optimal, as it does not leave enough room to assign the yellow process ``D``.

Planner does find the more optimal solution by using additional, smarter algorithms.
It also scales: both in data (more processes, more computers) and constraints (more hardware requirements, other constraints).
So let's see how Planner can be used in this scenario.

Here's an executive summary of this example and <<machineReassignment,an advanced implementation with more constraints>>:

[[cloudBalancingDomainModel]]
== Using the Domain Model


[[cloudBalancingDomainModelDesign]]
=== Domain Model Design

Using a <<domainModelingGuide,domain model>> helps determine which classes are planning entities and which of their properties are planning variables. It also helps to simplify contraints, improve performance, and increase flexibility for future needs. 

. Draw a class diagram of your domain model. 
. Normalize it to remove duplicate data.
. Write down some sample instances for each class. 

* ``Computer``: represents a computer with certain hardware and maintenance costs. 
+
In this example, the sample instances for the `Computer` class are: `cpuPower`, `memory`, `networkBandwidth`, `cost`. 
* ``Process``: represents a process with a demand. Needs to be assigned to a `Computer` by Planner. 
+
Sample instances for ``Process`` are: `requiredCpuPower`, `requiredMemory`, and `requiredNetworkBandwidth`.
* ``CloudBalance``: represents a problem. Contains every `Computer` and `Process` for a certain data set. 
+
The sample instance for `CloudBalance` is `score`.

. Determine which relationships (or fields) change during planning.

* Planning entity: the class (or classes) that changes during solving. In this example, it is the class ``Process``.
* Planning variable: the property (or properties) of a planning entity class that changes during solving. In this example, it is the property `computer` on the class ``Process``.
* Planning solution: the class that represents a data set and contains all planning entities. In this example that is the class ``CloudBalance``.

In the UML class diagram below, the Planner concepts are already annotated:

[[cloudBalancingDomainModelImplementation]]
=== Domain Model Implementation


[[cloudBalancingClassComputer]]
==== The `Computer` Class

The `Computer` class is a POJO (Plain Old Java Object). Usually, you will have more of this kind of classes with input data.

.CloudComputer.java
====
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class CloudComputer ... {

    private int cpuPower;
    private int memory;
    private int networkBandwidth;
    private int cost;

    ... // getters
}
----
====


[[cloudBalancingClassProcess]]
==== The `Process` Class

The `Process` class is particularly important. It is the class that is modified during solving.

We need to tell Planner that it can change the property ``computer``. To do this:
. Annotate the class with `@PlanningEntity`.
. Annotate the getter `getComputer()` with ``@PlanningVariable``.

Of course, the property `computer` needs a setter too, so Planner can change it during solving.

.CloudProcess.java
====
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningEntity(...)
public class CloudProcess ... {

    private int requiredCpuPower;
    private int requiredMemory;
    private int requiredNetworkBandwidth;

    private CloudComputer computer;

    ... // getters

    @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = {"computerRange"})
    public CloudComputer getComputer() {
        return computer;
    }

    public void setComputer(CloudComputer computer) {
        computer = computer;
    }

    // ************************************************************************
    // Complex methods
    // ************************************************************************

    ...

}
----
====

* Planner needs to know which values it can choose from to assign to the property ``computer``. Those values are retrieved from the method `CloudBalance.getComputerList()` on the planning solution, which returns a list of all computers in the current data set.

* The ``@PlanningVariable``'s `valueRangeProviderRefs` parameter on `CloudProcess.getComputer()` needs to match with the ``@ValueRangeProvider``'s `id` on CloudBalance.getComputerList().

[NOTE]
====
Instead of getter annotations, it is also possible to use <<annotationAlternatives,field annotations>>.
====


[[cloudBalancingClassCloudBalance]]
==== The `CloudBalance` Class

The `CloudBalance` class has a [path]_@PlanningSolution_
 annotation.
* It holds a list of all computers and processes.
* It represents both the planning problem and (if it's initialized) the planning solution.

. Planner needs to retrieve the collection of processes that it can change, therefore we annotate the getter `getProcessList()` with ``@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty``.

. The `CloudBalance` class also has a `@PlanningScore` annotated property ``score``, which is the `Score` of that solution in its current state.
Planner automatically updates it when it calculates a `Score` for a solution instance and therefore it needs a setter.

. Especially for score calculation with Drools, the property `computerList` needs to be annotated with a `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` so the computers are known to it.

.CloudBalance.java
====
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance ... {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;

    private List<CloudProcess> processList;

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {
        return computerList;
    }

    @PlanningEntityCollectionProperty
    public List<CloudProcess> getProcessList() {
        return processList;
    }

    @PlanningScore
    public HardSoftScore getScore() {
        return score;
    }

    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {
        this.score = score;
    }

    ...
}
----

[[cloudBalancingMainMethod]]
== Run the Cloud Balancing Hello World

. <<runTheExamplesInAnIDE,Download and configure the examples in your preferred IDE.>>
. Create a run configuration with the following main class: `org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.app.CloudBalancingHelloWorld`
+
By default, the Cloud Balancing Hello World is configured to run for 120 seconds.


It will execute the following code:

.CloudBalancingHelloWorld.java
====
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class CloudBalancingHelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build the Solver
        SolverFactory<CloudBalance> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(
                "org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
        Solver<CloudBalance> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();

        // Load a problem with 400 computers and 1200 processes
        CloudBalance unsolvedCloudBalance = new CloudBalancingGenerator().createCloudBalance(400, 1200);

        // Solve the problem
        CloudBalance solvedCloudBalance = solver.solve(unsolvedCloudBalance);

        // Display the result
        System.out.println("\nSolved cloudBalance with 400 computers and 1200 processes:\n"
                + toDisplayString(solvedCloudBalance));
    }

    ...
}
----
====

The code example does the following:

. Build the `Solver` based on a solver configuration (in this case <<solverConfigurationByXML,an XML file>>, `cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml`, from the classpath).
+ 
Building the `Solver` is the most complicated part of this procedure. For more detail, see <<cloudBalancingSolverConfiguration, Solver Configuration>>.

+

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
        SolverFactory<CloudBalance> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(
                "org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
        Solver solver<CloudBalance> = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

. Load the problem. 
+
`CloudBalancingGenerator` generates a random problem: you will replace this with a class that loads a real problem, for example from a database.
+

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
        CloudBalance unsolvedCloudBalance = new CloudBalancingGenerator().createCloudBalance(400, 1200);
----

. Solve the problem.
+

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
        CloudBalance solvedCloudBalance = solver.solve(unsolvedCloudBalance);
----

. Display the result.
+

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
        System.out.println("\nSolved cloudBalance with 400 computers and 1200 processes:\n"
                + toDisplayString(solvedCloudBalance));
----


[[cloudBalancingSolverConfiguration]]
== Solver Configuration

Take a look at the solver configuration:

.cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml
====
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver>
  <!-- Domain model configuration -->
  <scanAnnotatedClasses/>

  <!-- Score configuration -->
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <easyScoreCalculatorClass>org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.optional.score.CloudBalancingEasyScoreCalculator</easyScoreCalculatorClass>
    <!--<scoreDrl>org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl</scoreDrl>-->
  </scoreDirectorFactory>

  <!-- Optimization algorithms configuration -->
  <termination>
    <secondsSpentLimit>30</secondsSpentLimit>
  </termination>
</solver>
----
====

This solver configuration consists of three parts:

. **Domain model configuration**

*What can Planner change?*
+
We need to make Planner aware of our domain classes. In this configuration, it will automatically scan all classes in your classpath (for a `@PlanningEntity` or `@PlanningSolution` annotation):
+

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scanAnnotatedClasses/>
----
. **Score configuration** 

*How should Planner optimize the planning variables? What is our goal?*
+
Since we have hard and soft constraints, we use a ``HardSoftScore``. But we need to tell Planner how to calculate the score, depending on our business requirements. Further down, we will look into two alternatives to calculate the score: using an easy Java implementation, or using Drools DRL.
+

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <easyScoreCalculatorClass>org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.optional.score.CloudBalancingEasyScoreCalculator</easyScoreCalculatorClass>
    <!--<scoreDrl>org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl</scoreDrl>-->
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----
. **Optimization algorithms configuration** 

*How should Planner optimize it?*
+
In this case, we use the default <<optimizationAlgorithms,optimization algorithms>> (because no explicit optimization algorithms are configured) for 30 seconds:
+

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <secondsSpentLimit>30</secondsSpentLimit>
  </termination>
----
+
Planner should get a good result in seconds (and even in less than 15 milliseconds with <<realTimePlanning,real-time planning>>), but the more time it has, the better the result will be. Advanced use cases might use a different <<termination,termination criteria>> than a hard time limit.
+ 
The default algorithms will already easily surpass human planners and most in-house implementations.
Use the <<benchmarker,Benchmarker>> to <<powerTweaking,power tweak>> to get even better results.


[[cloudBalancingScoreConfiguration]]
== Score Configuration

Planner will search for the `Solution` with the highest ``Score``.
This example uses a ``HardSoftScore``, which means Planner will look for the solution with no hard constraints broken (fulfill hardware requirements) and as little as possible soft constraints broken (minimize maintenance cost).

image::Chapter-Quick_start/cloudBalanceScoreCalculation.png[align="center"]

Of course, Planner needs to be told about these domain-specific score constraints.
There are several ways to implement such a score function:

* <<cloudBalancingEasyJavaScoreConfiguration, Easy Java>>
* Incremental Java
* <<cloudBalancingDroolsScoreConfiguration, Drools>>


[[cloudBalancingEasyJavaScoreConfiguration]]
=== Easy Java Score Configuration

One way to define a score function is to implement the interface `EasyScoreCalculator` in plain Java.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <easyScoreCalculatorClass>org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.optional.score.CloudBalancingEasyScoreCalculator</easyScoreCalculatorClass>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----

Just implement the `calculateScore(Solution)` method to return a `HardSoftScore` instance.

.CloudBalancingEasyScoreCalculator.java
====
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class CloudBalancingEasyScoreCalculator implements EasyScoreCalculator<CloudBalance> {

    /**
     * A very simple implementation. The double loop can easily be removed by using Maps as shown in
     * {@link CloudBalancingMapBasedEasyScoreCalculator#calculateScore(CloudBalance)}.
     */
    public HardSoftScore calculateScore(CloudBalance cloudBalance) {
        int hardScore = 0;
        int softScore = 0;
        for (CloudComputer computer : cloudBalance.getComputerList()) {
            int cpuPowerUsage = 0;
            int memoryUsage = 0;
            int networkBandwidthUsage = 0;
            boolean used = false;

            // Calculate usage
            for (CloudProcess process : cloudBalance.getProcessList()) {
                if (computer.equals(process.getComputer())) {
                    cpuPowerUsage += process.getRequiredCpuPower();
                    memoryUsage += process.getRequiredMemory();
                    networkBandwidthUsage += process.getRequiredNetworkBandwidth();
                    used = true;
                }
            }
            
            // Hard constraints
            int cpuPowerAvailable = computer.getCpuPower() - cpuPowerUsage;
            if (cpuPowerAvailable < 0) {
                hardScore += cpuPowerAvailable;
            }
            int memoryAvailable = computer.getMemory() - memoryUsage;
            if (memoryAvailable < 0) {
                hardScore += memoryAvailable;
            }
            int networkBandwidthAvailable = computer.getNetworkBandwidth() - networkBandwidthUsage;
            if (networkBandwidthAvailable < 0) {
                hardScore += networkBandwidthAvailable;
            }
            
            // Soft constraints
            if (used) {
                softScore -= computer.getCost();
            }
        }
        return HardSoftScore.valueOf(hardScore, softScore);
    }

}
----
====

Even if we optimize the code above to use ``Map``s to iterate through the `processList` only once, _it is still slow_ because it does not do <<incrementalScoreCalculation,incremental score calculation>>.
To fix that, either use incremental Java score calculation or Drools score calculation.


[[cloudBalancingDroolsScoreConfiguration]]
=== Drools Score Configuration

Drools score calculation uses incremental calculation, where every score constraint is written as one or more score rules. 

Using the Drools rule engine for score calculation, allows you to integrate with other Drools technologies, such as decision tables (XLS or web based), the KIE Workbench, ...

*Prerequisite*
To use the Drools rule engine as a score function, simply add a `scoreDrl` resource in the classpath:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    <scoreDrl>org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl</scoreDrl>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----

. We want to make sure that all computers have enough CPU, RAM and network bandwidth to support all their processes, so we make these hard constraints:

global HardSoftScoreHolder scoreHolder;

// ############################################################################

rule "requiredCpuPowerTotal"
    when
        $computer : CloudComputer($cpuPower : cpuPower)
        accumulate(
            CloudProcess(
                computer == $computer,
                $requiredCpuPower : requiredCpuPower);
            $requiredCpuPowerTotal : sum($requiredCpuPower);
            $requiredCpuPowerTotal > $cpuPower
        )
    then
        scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, $cpuPower - $requiredCpuPowerTotal);
end

rule "requiredMemoryTotal"
    ...
end

rule "requiredNetworkBandwidthTotal"
    ...
end
----
====

. If those constraints are met, we want to minimize the maintenance cost, so we add that as a soft constraint:

        exists CloudProcess(computer == $computer)
    then
        scoreHolder.addSoftConstraintMatch(kcontext, - $cost);
end
----
====


[[cloudBalancingBeyondThisTutorial]]
== Beyond this Tutorial

Now that this simple example works, try going further.
Enrich the domain model and add extra constraints such as these:

* Each `Process` belongs to a ``Service``. A computer might crash, so processes running the same service should be assigned to different computers.
* Each `Computer` is located in a ``Building``. A building might burn down, so processes of the same services should be assigned to computers in different buildings.
