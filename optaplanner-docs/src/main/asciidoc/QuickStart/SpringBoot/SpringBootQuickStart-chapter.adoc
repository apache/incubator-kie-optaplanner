This guide walks you through the process of creating a Spring Boot
application with OptaPlanner's constraint solving artificial intelligence (AI).

== What you will build

You will build a REST application that optimizes a school timetable for students and teachers:

ifdef::COMMUNITY[]
image::QuickStart/SpringBoot/timeTableAppScreenshot.png[]
endif::COMMUNITY[]

ifdef::PRODUCTIZED[]
image::optimizer/timeTableAppScreenshot.png[]
endif::PRODUCTIZED[]

Your service will assign `Lesson` instances to `Timeslot` and `Room` instances automatically
by using AI to adhere to hard and soft scheduling _constraints_, such as the following examples:

* A room can have at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.
* A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher prefers to teach every lesson in a single room.
* A teacher prefers to teach sequential lessons and dislikes gaps between lessons.

Mathematically speaking, school timetabling is an _NP-hard_ problem.
This means it is difficult to scale.
Simply using brute force to iterate through all possible combinations would take millions of years for a non-trivial data set, even on a supercomputer.
Luckily, AI constraint solvers such as OptaPlanner have advanced algorithms
that deliver a near-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

.Prerequisites

* OpenJDK 8 or later is installed. Red Hat build of Open JDK is available from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Software Downloads] page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required).

* Apache Maven 3.2 or higher or  Gradle 4 or higher is installed. Maven is available from the https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven Project] website. Gradle is avaialbe from the https://gradle.org/install[Gradle Build Tool] website.

* An IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, Eclipse, or NetBeans is available.

== Summary

Congratulations!
You have just developed a https://spring.io/[Spring] application with https://www.optaplanner.org/[{PLANNER}]!

Take a look at the example's source code to see how this all turns out.
