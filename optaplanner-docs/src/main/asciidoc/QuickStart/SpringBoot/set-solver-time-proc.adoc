= Set the solver termination time

If your planning application does not have a termination setting or a termination event, it theoretically runs forever and in reality eventually causes an HTTP timeout error. To prevent this from occurring, use the `optaplanner.solver.termination.spent-limit` parameter to specify the length of time after which the application terminates. In most applications, set the time to at least five minutes (`5m`). However, in the Timetable example, limit the solving time to five second, which is short enough to avoid the HTTP timeout.

.Procedure
Create the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file with the following content:

[source,properties]
----
optaplanner.solver.termination.spent-limit=5s
----
