The goal of the {PLANNER} timetable project is to assign each lesson to a time slot and a room. To do this, add three classes, `Timeslot`, `Lesson`, and `Room`, as shown in the following diagram:

.Timeslot

The `Timeslot` class represents a time interval when lessons are taught,
for example, `Monday 10:30 - 11:30` or `Tuesday 13:30 - 14:30`.
In this example, all time slots have the same duration
and there are no time slots during lunch or other breaks.

A time slot has no date because a high school schedule just repeats every week.
There is no need for https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#continuousPlanning[continuous planning].
A `Timeslot` is called a _problem fact_ because no `Timeslot` instances change during solving.
Such classes do not require any {PLANNER} specific annotations.

.Room

The `Room` class represents a location where lessons are taught,
for example, `Room A` or `Room B`.
In this example, all rooms are without capacity limits
and they can accommodate all lessons.

`Room` instances do not change during solving so `Room` is also a _problem fact_.

.Lesson

During a lesson, represented by the `Lesson` class,
a teacher teaches a subject to a group of students,
for example, `Math by A.Turing for 9th grade` or `Chemistry by M.Curie for 10th grade`.
If a subject is taught multiple times each week by the same teacher to the same student group,
there are multiple `Lesson` instances that are only distinguishable by `id`.
For example, the 9th grade has six math lessons a week.

During solving, {PLANNER} changes the `timeslot` and `room` fields of the `Lesson` class
to assign each lesson to a time slot and a room.
Because {PLANNER} changes these fields, `Lesson` is a _planning entity_:

endif::COMMUNITY[]

ifdef::PRODUCTIZED[]
image::optimizer/timeTableClassDiagramAnnotated.png[]
endif::PRODUCTIZED[]

Most of the fields in the previous diagram contain input data, except for the orange fields.
A lesson's `timeslot` and `room` fields are unassigned (`null`) in the input data
and assigned (not `null`) in the output data.
{PLANNER} changes these fields during solving.
Such fields are called planning variables.
In order for {PLANNER} to recognize them,
both the `timeslot` and `room` fields require an `@PlanningVariable` annotation.
Their containing class, `Lesson`, requires an `@PlanningEntity` annotation.

.Procedure

. Create the `src/main/java/com/example/domain/Timeslot.java` class:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.example.domain;

import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.LocalTime;

public class Timeslot {

    private DayOfWeek dayOfWeek;
    private LocalTime startTime;
    private LocalTime endTime;

    private Timeslot() {
    }

    public Timeslot(DayOfWeek dayOfWeek, LocalTime startTime, LocalTime endTime) {
        this.dayOfWeek = dayOfWeek;
        this.startTime = startTime;
        this.endTime = endTime;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return dayOfWeek + " " + startTime.toString();
    }

    // ********************************
    // Getters and setters
    // ********************************

    public DayOfWeek getDayOfWeek() {
        return dayOfWeek;
    }

    public LocalTime getStartTime() {
        return startTime;
    }

    public LocalTime getEndTime() {
        return endTime;
    }

}
----

+
Notice the `toString()` method keeps the output short
so it is easier to read {PLANNER}'s `DEBUG` or `TRACE` log, as shown later.


. Create the `src/main/java/com/example/domain/Room.java` class:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.example.domain;

public class Room {

    private String name;

    private Room() {
    }

    public Room(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name;
    }

    // ********************************
    // Getters and setters
    // ********************************

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

}
----

. Create the `src/main/java/com/example/domain/Lesson.java` class:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.example.domain;

import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.entity.PlanningEntity;
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.variable.PlanningVariable;

@PlanningEntity
public class Lesson {

    private Long id;

    private String subject;
    private String teacher;
    private String studentGroup;

    @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = "timeslotRange")
    private Timeslot timeslot;

    @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = "roomRange")
    private Room room;

    private Lesson() {
    }

    public Lesson(Long id, String subject, String teacher, String studentGroup) {
        this.id = id;
        this.subject = subject;
        this.teacher = teacher;
        this.studentGroup = studentGroup;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return subject + "(" + id + ")";
    }

    // ********************************
    // Getters and setters
    // ********************************

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getSubject() {
        return subject;
    }

    public String getTeacher() {
        return teacher;
    }

    public String getStudentGroup() {
        return studentGroup;
    }

    public Timeslot getTimeslot() {
        return timeslot;
    }

    public void setTimeslot(Timeslot timeslot) {
        this.timeslot = timeslot;
    }

    public Room getRoom() {
        return room;
    }

    public void setRoom(Room room) {
        this.room = room;
    }

}
----
+
The `Lesson` class has an `@PlanningEntity` annotation,
so {PLANNER} knows that this class changes during solving
because it contains one or more planning variables.
+
The `timeslot` field has an `@PlanningVariable` annotation,
so {PLANNER} knows that it can change its value.
In order to find potential `Timeslot` instances to assign to this field,
{PLANNER} uses the `valueRangeProviderRefs` property to connect to a value range provider that provides a `List<Timeslot>` to pick from. See xref:business-optimizr-gather-objects-proc_{context}[] for information about value range providers.
+
The `room` field also has an `@PlanningVariable` annotation for the same reasons.

//We can't link to community docs from product docs so conditionalizing for community. If its important, I can include the section in the product doc but because this is a guided tutorial I don't think it is neccesary.
[NOTE]
====
Determining the `@PlanningVariable` fields for an arbitrary constraint solving use case
is often challenging the first time.
Read https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#domainModelingGuide[the domain modeling guidelines]
to avoid common pitfalls.
