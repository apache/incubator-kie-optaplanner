[[searchSpaceSize]]
== Search Space Size in the Real World

The number of possible solutions for a planning problem can be mind blowing.
For example:

* Four queens has `256` possible solutions (``4^4``) and two optimal solutions.
* Five queens has `3125` possible solutions (``5^5``) and one optimal solution.
* Eight queens has `16777216` possible solutions (``8^8``) and 92 optimal solutions.
* 64 queens has more than `10^115` possible solutions (``64^64``).
* Most real-life planning problems have an incredible number of possible solutions and only one or a few optimal solutions.

For comparison: the minimal number of atoms in the known universe (10^80). As a planning problem gets bigger, the search space tends to blow up really fast.
Adding only one extra planning entity or planning value can heavily multiply the running time of some algorithms.

image::OptimizationAlgorithms/cloudBalanceSearchSpaceSize.png[align="center"]

Calculating the number of possible solutions depends on the design of the domain model:

image::OptimizationAlgorithms/searchSpaceSizeCalculation.png[align="center"]


[NOTE]
====
This search space size calculation includes infeasible solutions (if they can be represented by the model), because:

* The optimal solution might be infeasible.
* There are many types of hard constraints that cannot be incorporated in the formula practically. For example, in Cloud Balancing, try incorporating the CPU capacity constraint in the formula.

Even in cases where adding some of the hard constraints in the formula is practical (for example, Course Scheduling), the resulting search space is still huge.
====

An algorithm that checks every possible solution (even with pruning, such as in <<branchAndBound,Branch And Bound>>) can easily run for billions of years on a single real-life planning problem.
The aim is to find the best solution in the available timeframe.
Planning competitions (such as the International Timetabling Competition) show that Local Search variations
(<<tabuSearch,Tabu Search>>, <<simulatedAnnealing,Simulated Annealing>>, <<lateAcceptance,Late Acceptance>>, ...)
usually perform best for real-world problems given real-world time limitations.


[[doesPlannerFindTheOptimalSolution]]
== Does Planner Find the Optimal Solution?

The business wants the optimal solution, but they also have other requirements:

* Scale out: Large production data sets must not crash and have also good results.
* Optimize the right problem: The constraints must match the actual business needs.
* Available time: The solution must be found in time, before it becomes useless to execute.
* Reliability: Every data set must have at least a decent result (better than a human planner).

Given these requirements, and despite the promises of some salesmen, it is usually impossible for anyone or anything to find the optimal solution.
Therefore, Planner focuses on finding the best solution in available time.
In <<examplesOverview,"realistic, independent competitions">>, it often comes out as the best _reusable_ software.

The nature of NP-complete problems make scaling a prime concern. 

[NOTE]
====
The quality of a result from a small data set is no indication of the quality of a result from a large data set.
====

Scaling issues cannot be mitigated by hardware purchases later on.
Start testing with a production sized data set as soon as possible.
Do not assess quality on small data sets (unless production encounters only such data sets). Instead, solve a production sized data set and compare the results of longer executions, different algorithms and - if available - the human planner.


[[architectureOverview]]
== Architecture Overview

Planner is the first framework to combine optimization algorithms (metaheuristics, ...) with score calculation by a rule engine (such as Drools Expert). This combination is very efficient, because:

* A rule engine, such as Drools Expert, is *great for calculating the score* of a solution of a planning problem. It makes it easy and scalable to add additional soft or hard constraints such as, "a teacher should not teach more then seven hours a day". It does delta-based score calculation without any extra code. However it tends to be not suitable to actually find new solutions.
* An optimization algorithm is *great at finding new improving solutions* for a planning problem, without necessarily brute-forcing every possibility. However, it needs to know the score of a solution and offers no support in calculating that score efficiently.

image::OptimizationAlgorithms/architectureOverview.png[align="center"]


[[optimizationAlgorithmsOverview]]
== Optimization Algorithms Overview

Planner supports three _families_ of optimization algorithms: Exhaustive Search, Construction Heuristics and Metaheuristics.
In practice, Metaheuristics (in combination with Construction Heuristics to initialize) are the recommended choice:

image::OptimizationAlgorithms/scalabilityOfOptimizationAlgorithms.png[align="center"]

Each of these algorithm families have multiple optimization algorithms:

[[whichOptimizationAlgorithmsShouldIUse]]
== Which Optimization Algorithms Should I Use?

The best optimization algorithms configuration to use depends heavily on your use case.
However, this basic procedure provides a good starting configuration that will produce better than average results.

. Start with a quick configuration that involves little or no configuration and optimization code:
 See <<firstFit,First Fit>>.

. Next, implement <<planningEntityDifficulty,planning entity difficulty>> comparison and turn it into <<firstFitDecreasing,First Fit Decreasing>>.

. Next, add Late Acceptance behind it:
.. First Fit Decreasing.
.. <<lateAcceptance,Late Acceptance>>. 

At this point, the return on invested time lowers and the result is likely to be sufficient.

However, this can be improved at a lower return on invested time.
Use the <<benchmarker,Benchmarker>> and try a couple of different Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance configurations, for example:

. First Fit Decreasing: <<tabuSearch,Tabu Search>>. 

Use the <<benchmarker,Benchmarker>> to improve the values for the size parameters.

Other experiments can also be run. For example, the following multiple algorithms can be combined together:

. First Fit Decreasing
. Late Acceptance (relatively long time)
. Tabu Search (relatively short time)


[[powerTweaking]]
== Power tweaking or default parameter values

Many optimization algorithms have parameters that affect results and scalability.
Planner applies __configuration by exception__, so all optimization algorithms have default parameter values.
This is very similar to the Garbage Collection parameters in a JVM: most users have no need to tweak them, but power users often do.

The default parameter values are sufficient for many cases (and especially for prototypes), but if development time allows, it may be beneficial to power tweak them with the <<benchmarker,benchmarker>> for better results and scalability on a specific use case.
The documentation for each optimization algorithm also declares the advanced configuration for power tweaking.

[WARNING]
====
The default value of parameters will change between minor versions, to improve them for most users. The advanced configuration can be used to prevent unwanted changes, however, this is not recommended.
====


[[solverPhase]]
== Solver Phase

A `Solver` can use multiple optimization algorithms in sequence.
*Each optimization algorithm is represented by one solver `Phase`.*
There is never more than one `Phase` solving at the same time.

[NOTE]
====
Some `Phase` implementations can combine techniques from multiple optimization algorithms, but it is still just one `Phase`.
For example: a Local Search `Phase` can do Simulated Annealing with entity Tabu.
====

Here is a configuration that runs three phases in sequence:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver>
  ...
  <constructionHeuristic>
    ... <!-- First phase: First Fit Decreasing -->
  </constructionHeuristic>
  <localSearch>
    ... <!-- Second phase: Late Acceptance -->
  </localSearch>
  <localSearch>
    ... <!-- Third phase: Tabu Search -->
  </localSearch>
</solver>
----

The solver phases are run in the order defined by solver configuration.

* When the first `Phase` terminates, the second `Phase` starts, and so on.
* When the last `Phase` terminates, the `Solver` terminates.

Usually, a `Solver` will first run a construction heuristic and then run one or multiple metaheuristics:

image::OptimizationAlgorithms/generalPhaseSequence.png[align="center"]

If no phases are configured, Planner will default to a Construction Heuristic phase followed by a Local Search phase.

Some phases (especially construction heuristics) will terminate automatically.
Other phases (especially metaheuristics) will only terminate if the `Phase` is configured to terminate:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver>
  ...
  <termination><!-- Solver termination -->
    <secondsSpentLimit>90</secondsSpentLimit>
  </termination>
  <localSearch>
    <termination><!-- Phase termination -->
      <secondsSpentLimit>60</secondsSpentLimit><!-- Give the next phase a chance to run too, before the Solver terminates -->
    </termination>
    ...
  </localSearch>
  <localSearch>
    ...
  </localSearch>
</solver>
----

If the `Solver` terminates (before the last `Phase` terminates itself,
the current phase is terminated and all subsequent phases will not run.


[[scopeOverview]]
== Scope Overview

A solver will iteratively run phases. Each phase will usually iteratively run steps. Each step, in turn, usually iteratively runs moves.
These form four nested scopes: 

. Solver
. Phase
. Step
. Move

image::OptimizationAlgorithms/scopeOverview.png[align="center"]

Configure <<logging,logging>> to display the log messages of each scope.


[[termination]]
== Termination

Not all phases terminate automatically and may take a significant amount of time.
A `Solver` can be terminated synchronously by up-front configuration, or asynchronously from another thread.

Metaheuristic phases in particular need to be instructed to stop solving.
This can be because of a number of reasons, for example, if the time is up, or the perfect score has been reached just before its solution is used.
Finding the optimal solution cannot be relied on (unless you know the optimal score), because a metaheuristic algorithm is generally unaware of the optimal solution.

This is not an issue for real-life problems, as finding the optimal solution may take more time than is available. 
Finding the best solution in the available time is the most important outcome.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If no termination is configured (and a metaheuristic algorithm is used), the `Solver` will run forever, until <<asynchronousTermination,terminateEarly()>> is called from another thread.
This is especially common during <<realTimePlanning,real-time planning>>.
====

For synchronous termination, configure a `Termination` on a `Solver` or a `Phase` when it needs to stop.
The built-in implementations of these should be sufficient, however a custom `Termination` can also be used.
Every `Termination` can calculate a _time gradient_ (needed for some optimization algorithms), which is a ratio between the time already spent solving and the estimated entire solving time of the `Solver` or `Phase`.


[[timeMillisSpentTermination]]
=== TimeMillisSpentTermination

Terminates when an amount of time has been used.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <millisecondsSpentLimit>500</millisecondsSpentLimit>
  </termination>
----

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <secondsSpentLimit>10</secondsSpentLimit>
  </termination>
----

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <minutesSpentLimit>5</minutesSpentLimit>
  </termination>
----

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <hoursSpentLimit>1</hoursSpentLimit>
  </termination>
----

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <daysSpentLimit>2</daysSpentLimit>
  </termination>
----

Multiple time types can be used together, for example to configure 150 minutes, either configure it directly:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <minutesSpentLimit>150</minutesSpentLimit>
  </termination>
----

Or use a combination that sums up to 150 minutes:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <hoursSpentLimit>2</hoursSpentLimit>
    <minutesSpentLimit>30</minutesSpentLimit>
  </termination>
----

[NOTE]
====
This `Termination` will most likely sacrifice perfect reproducibility (even with `environmentMode` `REPRODUCIBLE`) because the available CPU time differs frequently between runs:

* The available CPU time influences the number of steps that can be taken, which might be a few more or less.
* The `Termination` might produce slightly different time gradient values, which will send time gradient-based algorithms (such as Simulated Annealing) on a radically different path.

====


[[unimprovedTimeMillisSpentTermination]]
=== UnimprovedTimeMillisSpentTermination

Terminates when the best score has not improved in a specified amount of time.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <localSearch>
    <termination>
      <unimprovedMillisecondsSpentLimit>500</unimprovedMillisecondsSpentLimit>
    </termination>
  </localSearch>
----

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <localSearch>
    <termination>
      <unimprovedSecondsSpentLimit>10</unimprovedSecondsSpentLimit>
    </termination>
  </localSearch>
----

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <localSearch>
    <termination>
      <unimprovedMinutesSpentLimit>5</unimprovedMinutesSpentLimit>
    </termination>
  </localSearch>
----

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <localSearch>
    <termination>
      <unimprovedHoursSpentLimit>1</unimprovedHoursSpentLimit>
    </termination>
  </localSearch>
----

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <localSearch>
    <termination>
      <unimprovedDaysSpentLimit>1</unimprovedDaysSpentLimit>
    </termination>
  </localSearch>
----

This termination should not be applied to Construction Heuristics as they only update the best solution at the end.
Configuring it on a specific `Phase` (such as ``<localSearch>``), instead of on the `Solver` itself may be a better option.

[NOTE]
====
This `Termination` will most likely sacrifice perfect reproducibility (even with `environmentMode` ``REPRODUCIBLE``) as the available CPU time differs frequently between runs:

* The available CPU time influences the number of steps that can be taken, which might be a few more or less.
* The `Termination` might produce slightly different time gradient values, which will send time gradient based algorithms (such as Simulated Annealing) on a radically different path.

====


[[bestScoreTermination]]
=== BestScoreTermination

`BestScoreTermination` terminates when a certain score has been reached.
Use this `Termination` where the perfect score is known, for example for four queens (which uses a <<simpleScore,SimpleScore>>):

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <bestScoreLimit>0</bestScoreLimit>
  </termination>
----

A planning problem with a <<hardSoftScore,HardSoftScore>> may look like this:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <bestScoreLimit>0hard/-5000soft</bestScoreLimit>
  </termination>
----

A planning problem with a <<bendableScore,BendableScore>> with three hard levels and one soft level may look like this:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <bestScoreLimit>[0/0/0]hard/[-5000]soft</bestScoreLimit>
  </termination>
----

In this instance, `Termination` once a feasible solution has been reached is not practical because it requires a `bestScoreLimit` such as ``0hard/-2147483648soft``. Use the next termination instead.


[[bestScoreFeasibleTermination]]
=== BestScoreFeasibleTermination

Terminates as soon as a feasible solution has been discovered.
Requires that `Score` implements `FeasibilityScore`.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <bestScoreFeasible>true</bestScoreFeasible>
  </termination>
----

This `Termination` is usually combined with other terminations.


[[stepCountTermination]]
=== StepCountTermination

Terminates when a number of steps has been reached.
This is useful for hardware performance independent runs.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <localSearch>
    <termination>
      <stepCountLimit>100</stepCountLimit>
    </termination>
  </localSearch>
----

This `Termination` can only be used for a `Phase` (such as ``<localSearch>``), not for the `Solver` itself.


[[unimprovedStepCountTermination]]
=== UnimprovedStepCountTermination

Terminates when the best score has not improved in a number of steps.
This is useful for hardware performance independent runs.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <localSearch>
    <termination>
      <unimprovedStepCountLimit>100</unimprovedStepCountLimit>
    </termination>
  </localSearch>
----

If the score has not improved recently, it is unlikely to improve in a reasonable timeframe.
It has been observed that once a new best solution is found (even after a long time without improvement on the best solution), the next few steps tend to improve the best solution.

This `Termination` can only be used for a `Phase` (such as ``<localSearch>``), not for the `Solver` itself.


[[scoreCalculationCountTermination]]
=== ScoreCalculationCountTermination

`ScoreCalculationCountTermination` terminates when a number of score calculations have been reached.
This is often the sum of the number of moves and the number of steps.
This is useful for benchmarking.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <scoreCalculationCountLimit>100000</scoreCalculationCountLimit>
  </termination>
----

Switching <<environmentMode,EnvironmentMode>> can heavily impact when this termination ends.


[[combiningMultipleTerminations]]
=== Combining Multiple Terminations

Terminations can be combined, for example: terminate after `100` steps or if a score of `0` has been reached:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <terminationCompositionStyle>OR</terminationCompositionStyle>
    <stepCountLimit>100</stepCountLimit>
    <bestScoreLimit>0</bestScoreLimit>
  </termination>
----

Alternatively you can use `AND`, for example: terminate after reaching a feasible score of at least `-100` and no improvements in `5` steps:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <termination>
    <terminationCompositionStyle>AND</terminationCompositionStyle>
    <unimprovedStepCountLimit>5</unimprovedStepCountLimit>
    <bestScoreLimit>-100</bestScoreLimit>
  </termination>
----

This example ensures it does not just terminate after finding a feasible solution, but also completes any obvious improvements on that solution before terminating.


[[asynchronousTermination]]
=== Asynchronous Termination from Another Thread

Asychronous termination from another thread occurs when a `Solver` needs to be terminated early from another thread, for example, due to a user action or a server restart.
This cannot be configured by a `Termination` as it is impossible to predict when and if it will occur.
Therefore the `Solver` interface has the following thread-safe methods:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface Solver<Solution_> {
    ...

    boolean terminateEarly();
    boolean isTerminateEarly();

}
----

When calling the `terminateEarly()` method from another thread, the `Solver` will terminate at its earliest convenience and the `solve(Solution)` method will return (in the original `Solver` thread).

[NOTE]
====
Interrupting the Solver thread (which is the thread that called `Solver.solve(Solution)`) has the same affect as calling `terminateEarly()` except that it leaves that thread in the interrupted state.
This guarantees a graceful shutdown when an `ExecutorService` (such as a thread pool) is shutdown because that only interrupts all active threads in the pool.
====


[[SolverEventListener]]
== SolverEventListener

Each time a new best solution is found, a new `BestSolutionChangedEvent` is fired in the `Solver` thread.

To listen to such events, add a `SolverEventListener` to the ``Solver``:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface Solver<Solution_> {
    ...

    void addEventListener(SolverEventListener<S> eventListener);
    void removeEventListener(SolverEventListener<S> eventListener);

}
----

The ``BestSolutionChangedEvent``'s `newBestSolution` may not be initialized or feasible.
Use the `isFeasible()` method on ``BestSolutionChangedEvent``'s new best `Score` to detect such cases:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    solver.addEventListener(new SolverEventListener<CloudBalance>() {
        public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
            // Ignore infeasible (including uninitialized) solutions
            if (event.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isFeasible()) {
                ...
            }
        }
    });
----

Use `Score.isSolutionInitialized()` instead of `Score.isFeasible()` to only ignore uninitialized solutions, but also accept infeasible solutions.

[WARNING]
====
The `bestSolutionChanged()` method is called in the solver's thread, as part of `Solver.solve()`.
So it should return quickly to avoid slowing down the solving.
====


[[customSolverPhase]]
== Custom Solver Phase

Run a custom optmization algorithm etween phases or before the first phase to initialize the `Solution`, or to get a better score quickly.
You will still want to reuse the score calculation.
For example, to implement a custom Construction Heuristic without implementing an entire `Phase`.

[NOTE]
====
Most of the time, a custom solver phase is not worth the development time investment.
The supported <<constructionHeuristics,Constructions Heuristics>> are configurable (use the <<benchmarker,Benchmarker>> to tweak them),
`Termination` aware and support partially initialized solutions too.
====

The `CustomPhaseCommand` interface appears as follows:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface CustomPhaseCommand<Solution_> {
    ...

    void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<Solution_> scoreDirector);

}
----

For example, extend `AbstractCustomPhaseCommand` and implement the `changeWorkingSolution()` method:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class ToOriginalMachineSolutionInitializer extends AbstractCustomPhaseCommand<MachineReassignment> {

    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<MachineReassignment> scoreDirector) {
        MachineReassignment machineReassignment = scoreDirector.getWorkingSolution();
        for (MrProcessAssignment processAssignment : machineReassignment.getProcessAssignmentList()) {
            scoreDirector.beforeVariableChanged(processAssignment, "machine");
            processAssignment.setMachine(processAssignment.getOriginalMachine());
            scoreDirector.afterVariableChanged(processAssignment, "machine");
            scoreDirector.triggerVariableListeners();
        }
    }

}
----

[WARNING]
====
Any change on the planning entities in a `CustomPhaseCommand` must be notified to the ``ScoreDirector``.
====

[WARNING]
====
Do not change any of the problem facts in a `CustomPhaseCommand`.
That will corrupt the `Solver` because any previous score or solution was for a different problem.
To do that, read about <<repeatedPlanning,repeated planning>> and do it with a <<problemFactChange,ProblemFactChange>> instead.
====

`CustomPhaseCommand` can be configured using the following:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver>
  ...
  <customPhase>
    <customPhaseCommandClass>org.optaplanner.examples.machinereassignment.solver.solution.initializer.ToOriginalMachineSolutionInitializer</customPhaseCommandClass>
  </customPhase>
  ... <!-- Other phases -->
</solver>
----

Configure multiple `customPhaseCommandClass` instances to run them in sequence.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the changes of a `CustomPhaseCommand` do not result in a better score, the best solution will not be changed
(so effectively nothing will have changed for the next `Phase` or `CustomPhaseCommand`).
To force such changes anyway, use `forceUpdateBestSolution`:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <customPhase>
    <customPhaseCommandClass>...MyCustomPhase</customPhaseCommandClass>
    <forceUpdateBestSolution>true</forceUpdateBestSolution>
  </customPhase>
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If the `Solver` or a `Phase` wants to terminate while a `CustomPhaseCommand` is still running,
it will wait to terminate until the `CustomPhaseCommand` is complete.
This may take a significant amount of time.
The built-in solver phases do not have this issue.
====

To configure values of a `CustomPhaseCommand` dynamically in the solver configuration
(so the <<benchmarker,Benchmarker>> can tweak those parameters), add the `customProperties` element:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <customPhase>
    <customProperties>
      <mySelectionSize>5</mySelectionSize>
    </customProperties>
  </customPhase>
----

Then add a public setter for each custom property, which is called when a `Solver` is build.
Most value types are supported (including boolean, integers, doubles and strings).

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class MyCustomPhase extends AbstractCustomPhaseCommand<MySolution> {

    private int mySelectionSize = 10;

    @SuppressWarnings("unused")
    public void setMySelectionSize(int mySelectionSize) {
        this.mySelectionSize = mySelectionSize;
    }

    ...
}
----


[[noChangeSolverPhase]]
== No Change Solver Phase

In rare cases, it can be useful to configure that no solver phase should be run.
But by default, configuring no phase will trigger the use of the default phases.
To avoid those, configure a `NoChangePhase`:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver>
  ...
  <noChangePhase/>
</solver>
----


[[multiThreadedSolving]]
== Multi-threaded Solving

There are several ways of doing multi-threaded solving:

image::OptimizationAlgorithms/multiThreadingStrategies.png[align="center"]

For now, only Partitioned Search is supported out of the box.

[NOTE]
====
A <<logging,logging level>> of `debug` or `trace` might cause congestion multi-threaded solving
and slow down the <<scoreCalculationSpeed,score calculation speed>>.
====
