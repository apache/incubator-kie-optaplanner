[[partitionedSearchOverview]]
== Overview

For very big datasets, it is sometimes worthwhile to partition the datasets into smaller pieces.

However, **partitioning leads to suboptimal results**, even if the pieces are solved optimally:

A future version of Planner will have native support for several forms of partitioning.
Meanwhile, you can implement it yourself as shown in the image above.
Use an `Solver` to solve each piece.

[NOTE]
====
Not all use cases can be partitioned.
It only works on use cases for which the planning entities and value ranges can be divided into n pieces, such that none of the constraints cross piece boundaries.
