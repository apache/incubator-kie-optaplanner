= Backup Planning

Backup planning adds extra score constraints to create space in the planning for when things go wrong. That creates a backup plan within the plan itself.

An example of backup planning is as follows:

. Create an extra score constraint. For example:
+
* Assign an employee as the spare employee (one for every 10 shifts at the same time).
* Keep one hospital bed open in each department.
. Change the planning problem when an unforeseen event occurs. 
+
For example, if an employee calls in sick: 
+
* Delete the sick employee and leave their shifts unassigned.
* Restart the planning, starting from that solution, which now has a different score.

The construction heuristics fills in the newly created gaps (probably with the spare employee) and the metaheuristics will improve it even further.
