Constraint streams are a Functional Programming form of incremental score calculation in plain Java that is easy to
read, write and debug.
The API should feel familiar if you've worked with Java 8 Streams or SQL.

[WARNING]
====
The ConstraintStreams/ConstraintProvider API is an ongoing project.
It works but it has many API gaps.
Therefore, it is not rich enough yet to handle complex constraints.

[[constraintStreamsIntroduction]]
== Introduction

Using Java 8's Streams API, we could implement an <<easyJavaScoreCalculation,easy score calculator>>
that uses a functional approach:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private int doNotAssignAnn() {
        int softScore = 0;
        schedule.getShiftList().stream()
                .filter(Shift::isEmployeeAnn)
                .forEach(shift -> {
                    softScore -= 1;
                });
        return softScore;
    }
----

However, that scales poorly because it doesn't do an <<incrementalScoreCalculation,incremental calculation>>:
When the planning variable of a single `Talk` changes, to recalculate the score,
the normal Streams API has to execute the entire stream from scratch.
The ConstraintStreams API allows you to write similar code in pure Java, while reaping the performance benefits of
incremental score calculation.
This is an example of the same code, using the Constraint Streams API:

// TODO Rewrite the above paragraph PLANNER-1709 is fixed, mentioning constraint justification as another benefit.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint doNotAssignAnn(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Shift.class)
                .filter(Shift::isEmployeeAnn)
                .penalize("Don't assign Ann", HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT);
    }
----

This constraint stream goes over all instances of class `Shift` amongst <<problemFacts,problem facts>> and
<<planningEntity,planning entities>> in the <<planningProblemAndPlanningSolution,planning problem>>.
It finds all which are assigned to employee `Ann` and for every such instance (also called "a match"), it adds a soft
penalty of 1 to the overall <<calculateTheScore,score>>.
The following figure illustrates this process on a problem with 4 different shifts:

If any of the instances change during solving, the constraint stream automatically detects it and only recalculates
the minimum necessary portion of the problem that is affected by the change.
The following figure illustrates this <<incrementalScoreCalculation,incremental score calculation>>:

[[constraintStreamsFirst]]
== Your First Constraint Stream

To use the ConstraintStreams API in your project, first write a pure Java `ConstraintProvider` implementation like this:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    public class MyConstraintProvider implements ConstraintProvider {

        @Override
        public Constraint[] defineConstraints(ConstraintFactory factory) {
            return new Constraint[] { // Provide as many constraints as you like. This example only provides one.
                    firstConstraint(factory)
            };
        }

        private Constraint firstConstraint(ConstraintFactory factory) {
            return factory.from(...) // Choose the initial source of the constraint stream.
                // Add as many building blocks as you need.
                .penalize(...); // And finally define the penalty associated with this constraint.
        }

    }
----

Then use the following in your solver config:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <solver>
      <scoreDirectorFactory>
        <constraintProviderClass>com.example.MyConstraintProvider</constraintProviderClass>
      </scoreDirectorFactory>
      ...
    </solver>
----


[[constraintStreamsCardinality]]
== Constraint Stream Cardinality

Stream cardinality is a measure of how many objects a single constraint match consists of.
The simplest constraint stream has a cardinality of 1, meaning each constraint match only consists of 1 object.
Therefore, it is called a `UniStream`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint doNotAssignAnn(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Shift.class) // Returns UniStream<Shift>.
                ...
    }
----

Some constraint stream <<constraintStreamsBuildingBlocks, building blocks>> can increase stream cardinality, such as
<<constraintStreamsJoin,join>> or <<constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors,groupBy>>:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint doNotAssignAnn(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Shift.class) // Returns Uni<Shift>.
                .join(Employee.class)    // Returns Bi<Shift, Employee>.
                .join(DayOff.class)      // Returns Tri<Shift, Employee, DayOff>.
                .join(Country.class)     // Returns Quad<Shift, Employee, DayOff, Country>.
                ...
    }
----

The latter can also decrease stream cardinality:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint doNotAssignAnn(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Shift.class) // Returns UniStream<Shift>.
                .join(Employee.class) // Returns BiStream<Shift, Employee>.
                .groupBy((shift, employee) -> employee) // Returns UniStream<Employee>.
                ...
    }
----

The following constraint stream cardinalities are currently supported.

|===
|Cardinality|Prefix|Defining interface
|1          |   Uni|`UniConstraintStream<A>`
|2          |    Bi|`BiConstraintStream<A, B>`
|3          |   Tri|`TriConstraintStream<A, B, C>`
|4          |  Quad|`QuadConstraintStream<A, B, C, D>`
|===


[[constraintStreamsBuildingBlocks]]
== Building Blocks

Constraint streams are chains of different operations, also called building blocks.
Each constraint stream starts with a `from(...)` building block and is terminated by either a penalty or a reward.
This is an example of the simplest possible constraint stream:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint penalizeInitializedShifts(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Shift.class)
                .penalize("Initialized shift", HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT);
    }
----

This constraint stream will go over all known and initialized instances of `Shift`.
To include instances yet uninitialized, replace the `from()` building block with `fromUnfiltered()`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint penalizeAllShifts(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.fromUnfiltered(Shift.class)
                .penalize("A shift", HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT);
    }
----


[[constraintStreamsPenaltiesRewards]]
=== Penalties And Rewards

The purpose of constraint streams is to build up a <<whatIsAScore,score>> for a <<planningProblemAndPlanningSolution,solution>>.
To accomplish that, every constraint stream must be terminated by a call to either a `penalize()` or a `reward()`
building block.
As their names suggest, the former makes the score worse while the latter improves it.
Penalties and rewards have several components:

Constraint name::
Human readable descriptive name for the constraint, which must be unique within the entire `ConstraintProvider`.
Constraint weight::
A constant score value indicating how much every breach of the constraint affects the score.
Valid examples include `SimpleScore.ONE`, `HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD`, `HardMediumSoftScore.of(1, 2, 3)`, ...
Constraint match weigher (Optional)::
A function indicating how many times the constraint weight should be applied in the score.
This number is typically determined from the contents of the constraint stream.
Defaults to 1.
Constraint package (Optional)::
Java package that the constraint resides in.
Defaults to the package where the `ConstraintProvider` resides.

The ConstraintStreams API supports many different types of penalties and we suggest you browse the API in your IDE for
the full list of method overloads. Here are some examples:

Simple penalty::
`penalize("Constraint name", SimpleScore.ONE)`
Makes the score worse by 1 per every match in the constraint stream.
In place of `SimpleScore.ONE`, you may use any `Score` depending on the needs of your problem.
Dynamic penalty::
`penalize("Constraint name", SimpleScore.ONE, Shift::getHours)`
Makes the score worse by the number of hours in every matching `Shift` in the constraint stream.
This is an example of using a constraint match weigher.
Configurable penalty::
`penalizeConfigurable("Constraint name")`
Makes the score worse using constraint weights defined in <<constraintConfiguration,constraint configuration>>.
Configurable dynamic penalty::
`penalizeConfigurable("Constraint name", Shift::getHours)`
Makes the score worse using constraint weights defined in <<constraintConfiguration,constraint configuration>>,
multiplied by the number of hours in every matching `Shift` in the constraint stream.

By replacing the keyword `penalize` by `reward` in the name of these building blocks, you will get operations that
affect score in the opposite direction.


[[constraintStreamsFilter]]
=== Filter

Filtering allows you to reduce the number of constraint matches in your stream.
It first enumerate all constraint matches and then applies a predicate to filter some of them out.
The predicate is a function that only returns `true` if the match is to continue in the stream.
The following constraint stream will remove all of Beth's shifts from all `Shift` matches:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint penalizeAnnShifts(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Shift.class)
                .filter(shift -> shift.getEmployeeName().equals("Ann"))
                .penalize("Ann's shift", SimpleScore.ONE);
    }
----

For a bi constraint match of `Shift` and `DayOff`, here's how to get a list of shifts where an employee has asked for a
day off:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint penalizeShiftsOnOffDays(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Shift.class)
                .join(DayOff.class)
                .filter((shift, dayOff) -> shift.date == dayOff.date && shift.employee == dayOff.employee)
                .penalize("Shift on an off-day", SimpleScore.ONE);
    }
----

The following figure illustrates both these examples:

image::ConstraintStreams/constraintStreamFilter.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
For reasons of performance, using the <<constraintStreamsJoin,join>> building block with appropriate `Joiner`s is
preferrable when possible.
Using a `Joiner` creates only the constraint matches that are necessary, while filtered join creates all possible
constraint matches and only then filters some of them out.
====

For reference, we include a list of predicate functions required for filtering constraint streams of different
cardinality:

|===
|Stream Cardinality|Filtering Predicate
|1                 |`java.util.function.Predicate<A>`
|2                 |`java.util.function.BiPredicate<A, B>`
|3                 |`org.optaplanner.core.api.function.TriPredicate<A, B, C>`
|4                 |`org.optaplanner.core.api.function.QuadPredicate<A, B, C, D>`
|===


[[constraintStreamsJoin]]
=== Join

Joining is a way to increase <<constraintStreamsCardinality,stream cardinality>> and it is similar to inner join
operation in SQL. As the following figure illustrates, a join creates a cartesian product of the streams being joined:

image::ConstraintStreams/constraintStreamJoinWithoutJoiners.png[align="center"]

This is inefficient, as the resulting stream may contain constraint matches that are of no interest to your constraint.
Therefore, we recommend using `Joiner` to restrict your joins only to the matches you are actually interested in, as
illustrated in this figure:

image::ConstraintStreams/constraintStreamJoinWithJoiners.png[align="center"]

For a list of all supported `Joiner` implementations, please refer to the
`org.optaplanner.core.api.score.stream.Joiners` class.


[[constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors]]
=== Grouping and Collectors

Grouping collects items in a stream according to user-provider criteria (also called "group key"), similar to what a
`GROUP BY` SQL clause does. Additionally, some grouping operations also accept one or more `Collector`, which provide
various aggregation functions. The following figure illustrates a simple `groupBy()` operation:

image::ConstraintStreams/constraintStreamGroupBy.png[align="center"]

For example, the following code snippet first groups all processes by the computer they run on, sums up all the power
required by the processes on that computer using the `ConstraintCollectors.sum(...)` collector, and finally penalizes
every computer whose processes consume more power than is available.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint requiredCpuPowerTotal(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.from(CloudProcess.class)
                .groupBy(CloudProcess::getComputer, sum(CloudProcess::getRequiredCpuPower))
                .filter((computer, requiredCpuPower) -> requiredCpuPower > computer.getCpuPower())
                .penalize("requiredCpuPowerTotal",
                        HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD,
                        (computer, requiredCpuPower) -> requiredCpuPower - computer.getCpuPower());
    }
----

[NOTE]
====
Information may be lost during grouping.
In the example above, `filter()` and all subsequent operations no longer have direct access to the original
`CloudProcess` instance.
====

There are several collectors available out of the box. You can also provide your own collectors by implementing the
`org.optaplanner.core.api.score.stream.uni.UniConstraintCollector` interface, or its `Bi...`, `Tri...` counterparts.

[collectorsOutOfTheBox]
==== Out-of-the-box Collectors

The following section focuses on the collector implementations provided out of the box. This section only describes the
`int`-based variants of the collectors in detail. Many of the collectors also provide variants for other applicable
result data types, such as `long`, `BigDecimal` or `Duration`. You can find a complete list by exploring the
`org.optaplanner.core.api.score.stream.ConstraintCollectors` class.

[collectorsCount]
===== Collecting `count()`

The `ConstraintCollectors.count(...)` counts all elements in a group. For example, the following use of the collector
gives a number of items for two separate groups - one where the talks have unavailable speakers, and one where they
don't.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint speakerAvailability(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Talk.class)
                .groupBy(Talk::hasAnyUnavailableSpeaker, count())
                .penalize("speakerAvailability",
                        HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD,
                        (hasUnavailableSpeaker, count) -> ...);
    }
----

The return value for this collector is a 32-bit signed integer (`int`). There is also a 64-bit variant, `countLong()`.

[collectorsCountDistinct]
===== Collecting `countDistinct()`

The `ConstraintCollectors.countDistinct(...)` counts any element in a group once, regardless of how many times it
occurs. For example, the following use of the collector gives a number of talks in each unique room.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint roomCount(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.from(Talk.class)
                .groupBy(Talk::getRoom, countDistinct())
                .penalize("roomCount",
                        HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                        (room, count) -> ...);
    }
----

The return value for this collector is a 32-bit signed integer (`int`). There is also a 64-bit variant, `countLong()`.

[collectorsSum]
===== Collecting `sum()`

To sum the values of a particular property of all elements in the group, use the `ConstraintCollectors.sum(...)`
collector. The following code snippet first groups all processes by the computer they run on and sums up all the power
required by the processes on that computer using the `ConstraintCollectors.sum(...)` collector.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint requiredCpuPowerTotal(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.from(CloudProcess.class)
                .groupBy(CloudProcess::getComputer, sum(CloudProcess::getRequiredCpuPower))
                .penalize("requiredCpuPowerTotal",
                        HardSoftScore.ONE_SOFT,
                        (computer, requiredCpuPower) -> requiredCpuPower);
    }
----

The return value for this collector is a 32-bit signed integer (`int`). There are also the following variants:

* 64-bit variant `sumLong()`
* `java.math.BigDecimal`-based variant `sumBigDecimal()`
* `java.math.BigInteger`-based variant `sumBigInteger()`
* `java.time.Duration`-based variant `sumDuration()`
* `java.time.Period`-based variant `sumPeriod()`


[collectorsMinMax]
===== Minimums and maximums

To extract the minimum or maximum of a group, use the `ConstraintCollectors.min(...)` and
`ConstraintCollectors.max(...)` collectors respectively.

These collectors operate on values of properties which are `Comparable` (such as `Integer`, `String` or `Duration`),
although there are also variants of these collectors which allow you to provide your own `Comparator`.

The following example finds a computer which runs the most power-demanding process:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    private Constraint computerWithBiggestProcess(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.from(CloudProcess.class)
                .groupBy(CloudProcess::getComputer, max(CloudProcess::getRequiredCpuPower))
                .penalize("computerWithBiggestProcess",
                        HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD,
                        computer -> ...);
    }
----


[[constraintStreamsImplementations]]
== Variant implementation types

Constraint streams come in two flavours, a default implementation using Drools under the hood and a pure Java-based
implementation called _Bavet_.
Drools-based implementation is more feature-complete.
Both of these implementations use the same `ConstraintProvider` API, no Java code changes are necessary to switch
between the two.

Bavet is an experimental implementation focusing on raw speed, which often significantly outperforms the default
implementation, or even Drools itself.
However, it lacks features and therefore many of the <<examplesOverview,examples>> are not supported.
To try it out, implement the `ConstraintProvider` interface and use the following in your solver config:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
    <solver>
      <scoreDirectorFactory>
        <constraintStreamImplType>BAVET</constraintStreamImplType>
        <constraintProviderClass>com.example.MyConstraintProvider</constraintProviderClass>
      </scoreDirectorFactory>
      ...
    </solver>
----
