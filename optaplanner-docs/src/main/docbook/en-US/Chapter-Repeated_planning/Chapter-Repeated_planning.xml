    <title>Introduction to Repeated Planning</title>

    <para>The world constantly changes. The problem facts used to create a solution, might change before or during the
    execution of that solution. There are different situations (which can be combined):</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Unforeseen fact changes</emphasis>: For example: an employee assigned to a shift calls in sick,
        an airplane scheduled to take off has a technical delay, one of the machines or vehicles break down, ... Use
        <emphasis role="bold">backup planning</emphasis>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Impossible to assign all entities now</emphasis>: Leave some unassigned. For example: there are
        10 shifts at the same time to assign but only 9 employees to handle shifts. Use <emphasis
        role="bold">overconstrained planning</emphasis>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Unknown long term future facts</emphasis>: For example: The hospital admissions for the next 2
        weeks are reliable, but those for week 3 and 4 are less reliable and for week 5 and beyond are not worth
        planning yet. Use <emphasis role="bold">continuous planning</emphasis>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Constantly changing problem facts</emphasis>: Use <emphasis role="bold">real-time
        planning</emphasis>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Waiting to start planning - to lower the risk of problem facts changing - usually isn't a good way to deal
    with that. More CPU time means a better planning solution. An incomplete plan is better than no plan.</para>

    <para>Luckily, the optimization algorithms support planning a solution that's already (partially) planned, known as
    repeated planning.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="backupPlanning">
    <title>Backup Planning</title>

    <para>Backup planning is the technique of adding extra score constraints to create space in the planning for when
    things go wrong. That creates a backup plan in the plan. For example: try to assign an employee as the spare
    employee (1 for every 10 shifts at the same time), keep 1 hospital bed open in each department, ...</para>

    <para>Then, when things go wrong (one of the employees calls in sick), change the problem facts on the original
    solution (delete the sick employee leave his/her shifts unassigned) and just restart the planning, starting from
    that solution, which has a different score now. The construction heuristics will fill in the newly created gaps
    (probably with the spare employee) and the metaheuristics will even improve it further.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="overconstrainedPlanning">
    <title>Overconstrained Planning</title>

    <para>When there is no feasible solution to assign all planning entities, it's often desired to assign as many
    entities as possible without breaking hard constraints. This is called overconstrained planning.</para>

    <para>By default, Planner will assign all planning entities, overload the planning values and therefore break hard
    constraints. There are 2 ways to avoid that:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Use <link linkend="nullablePlanningVariable">nullable</link> planning variables, so some entities are
        unassigned.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Add virtual values to catch the unassigned entities.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section xml:id="overconstrainedPlanningWithNullableVariables">
      <title>Overconstrained Planning with Nullable Variables</title>

      <para>If we handle overconstrained planning with nullable variables, the overload entities will be left
      unassigned:</para>

  <section xml:id="continuousPlanning">
    <title>Continuous Planning (Windowed Planning)</title>

    <para>Continuous planning is the technique of planning one or more upcoming planning periods at the same time and
    repeating that process monthly, weekly, daily, hourly or even more frequently. Time is infinite, so planning all
    future time periods is impossible. Instead, plan a planning window of a fixed number of upcoming planning time
    periods, and consider anything beyond that out of scope.</para>

    <para>The planning window can be split up in several parts:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">History</emphasis>: Past time periods that immutable. It contains only immovable
        entities.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Historic entities can affect score constraints that apply to movable entities too. For example in
            nurse rostering, a nurse that has worked the last 5 historic days in a row, should not be assigned on the
            first tentative day of the planning window because then she's work too many days in a row.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Do not load all historic entities in memory: even though immovable entities don't affect solving
            performance, they can cause out of memory problems when the data grows to years. Only load those that might
            still affect the current constraints with a good safety margin, for example load the past year.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Tentative</emphasis>: The first few time periods that are being planned freely for
        the last time. After this planning, their planning entities become <link
        linkend="immovablePlanningEntities">immovable</link> or <link
        linkend="nonvolatileReplanning">semi-immovable</link>.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The result of the tentative planning is usually shared with the business. For example in nurse
            rostering, the nurses will use this schedule to plan their personal lives. Changing that schedule later
            becomes disruptive (but if exceptions force us to do so, <link linkend="nonvolatileReplanning">we minimize
            disruption</link>).</para>

        the last time. They are likely to change again in the next planning effort.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The draft part is needed to assure that the tentatively planned entities will allow room of a good,
            feasible planning afterwards. It prevents you from painting yourself in a corner.</para>

            <para>If <link linkend="assigningTimeToPlanningEntities">time is a planning variable</link>, there is no

    <para>Notice the difference between the original planning of November 1th and the new planning of November 5th: some
    problem facts (F, H, I, J, K) changed meanwhile, which results in unrelated planning entities (G) changing
    too.</para>

    <section xml:id="immovablePlanningEntities">
      <title>Immovable Planning Entities</title>

      <para>To make some planning entities immovable, simply add an entity <literal>SelectionFilter</literal> that
      returns <literal>true</literal> if an entity is movable and <literal>false</literal> if it is immovable.</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class MovableShiftAssignmentSelectionFilter implements SelectionFilter&lt;NurseRoster, ShiftAssignment&gt; {

        ShiftDate shiftDate = shiftAssignment.getShift().getShiftDate();
        return nurseRoster.getNurseRosterInfo().isInPlanningWindow(shiftDate);
    }

public class ShiftAssignment {
    ...
}</programlisting>

      <warning>
        <para>Custom <literal>MoveListFactory</literal> and <literal>MoveIteratorFactory</literal> implementations must

    <section xml:id="nonvolatileReplanning">
      <title>Nonvolatile Replanning to minimize disruption (Semi-movable Planning Entities)</title>

      <para>Replanning an existing plan can be very disruptive on the plan. If the plan affects humans (such as
      employees, drivers, ...), very disruptive changes are often undesirable. In such cases, nonvolatile replanning
      helps by restricting planning freedom: the gain of changing a plan must be higher than the disruption it causes.
      This is usually implemented by taxing all planning entities that change.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Repeated_planning/nonvolatileReplanning.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>For example, in the Machine Reassignment example, the entity has both the planning variable
      <literal>machine</literal> and its original value <literal>originalMachine</literal>:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity(...)
public class ProcessAssignment {

    private MrProcess process;
    private Machine originalMachine;
    private Machine machine;

    public Machine getOriginalMachine() {...}

    @PlanningVariable(...)
    public Machine getMachine() {...}

    public boolean isMoved() {
        return originalMachine != null &amp;&amp; originalMachine != machine;
    }

    ...
}</programlisting>

      <para>During planning, the planning variable <literal>machine</literal> changes. By comparing it with the
      originalMachine, a change in plan can be penalized:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "processMoved"
    when
        ProcessAssignment(moved == true)
    then
        scoreHolder.addSoftConstraintMatch(kcontext, -1000);
end</programlisting>

      <para>The soft penalty of <literal>-1000</literal> means that a better solution is only accepted if it improves
      the soft score for at least <literal>1000</literal> points per variable changed (or if it improves the hard
      score).</para>

  <section xml:id="realTimePlanning">
    <title>Real-time Planning</title>

    <para>To do real-time planning, first combine <link linkend="backupPlanning">backup planning</link> and <link
    linkend="continuousPlanning">continuous planning</link> with short planning windows to lower the burden of real-time
    planning. As time passes, the problem itself changes:</para>

    <para>In the example above, 3 customers are added at different times (<literal>07:56</literal>,
    <literal>08:02</literal> and <literal>08:45</literal>), after the original customer set finished solving at

      <para>While the <literal>Solver</literal> is solving, an outside event might want to change one of the problem

      instances used by the <literal>Solver</literal> while it is solving (from another thread or even in the same

      <important>
        <para>To write a <literal>ProblemFactChange</literal> correctly, it's important to understand the behaviour of
        <link linkend="cloningASolution">a planning clone</link>:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Any change in a <literal>ProblemFactChange</literal> must be done on the <literal>Solution</literal>

      <note>
        <para>Many types of changes can leave a planning entity uninitialized, resulting in a partially initialized
        solution. That's fine, as long as the first solver phase can handle it. All construction heuristics solver

      <para>In essence, the <literal>Solver</literal> stops, runs the <literal>ProblemFactChange</literal> and <emphasis

      adjusted best solution of the previous run. Each solver phase runs again. This implies the construction heuristic
      runs again, but because little or no planning variables are uninitialized (unless you have a <link

      start.</para>

      <para>Each configured <literal>Termination</literal> resets (both in solver and phase configuration), but a

  &lt;daemon&gt;true&lt;/daemon&gt;
  ...
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

      <warning>
        <para>Don't forget to call <literal>Solver.terminateEarly()</literal> when your application needs to shutdown to
        avoid killing the solver thread unnaturally.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>Subscribe to the <literal><link linkend="SolverEventListener">BestSolutionChangedEvent</link></literal> to
      process new best solutions found by the solver thread. A <literal>BestSolutionChangedEvent</literal> doesn't
      guarantee that every <literal>ProblemFactChange</literal> has been processed already, nor that the solution is
      initialized and feasible. To ignore <literal>BestSolutionChangedEvent</literal>s with such invalid solutions, do
      this:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent&lt;CloudBalance&gt; event) {
        // Ignore invalid solutions
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                &amp;&amp; event.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()
                &amp;&amp; event.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isFeasible()) {
            ...
        }
    }</programlisting>
