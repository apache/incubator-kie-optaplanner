    <section>
      <title>Solver configuration by XML file</title>

      <para>You can build a <literal>Solver</literal> instance with the <literal>XmlSolverFactory</literal>. Configure
      it with a solver configuration XML file:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">       XmlSolverFactory solverFactory = new XmlSolverFactory(
               "/org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");
       Solver solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();</programlisting>

      <para>A solver configuration file looks something like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;solver&gt;
  &lt;!-- Define the model --&gt;
  &lt;solutionClass&gt;org.optaplanner.examples.nqueens.domain.NQueens&lt;/solutionClass&gt;
  &lt;planningEntityClass&gt;org.optaplanner.examples.nqueens.domain.Queen&lt;/planningEntityClass&gt;

  &lt;!-- Define the score function --&gt;
  &lt;scoreDirectorFactory&gt;
    &lt;scoreDefinitionType&gt;SIMPLE&lt;/scoreDefinitionType&gt;
    &lt;scoreDrl&gt;/org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nQueensScoreRules.drl&lt;/scoreDrl&gt;
  &lt;/scoreDirectorFactory&gt;

  &lt;!-- Configure the optimization algorithm(s) --&gt;
  &lt;termination&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/termination&gt;
  &lt;constructionHeuristic&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/constructionHeuristic&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Notice the 3 parts in it:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Define the model</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Configure the optimization algorithm(s)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>We'll explain these various parts of a configuration later in this manual.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">OptaPlanner makes it relatively easy to switch optimization algorithm(s) just by
      changing the configuration.</emphasis> There's even a <literal>Benchmark</literal> utility which allows you to
      play out different configurations against each other and report the most appropriate configuration for your
      problem. You could for example play out tabu search versus simulated annealing, on 4 queens and 64 queens.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Solver configuration by Java API</title>

      <para>As an alternative to the XML file, a solver configuration can also be configured with the
      <literal>SolverConfig</literal> API:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">        SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig();

        solverConfig.setSolutionClass(NQueens.class);
        solverConfig.setPlanningEntityClassList(Collections.&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt;singletonList(Queen.class));

        ScoreDirectorFactoryConfig scoreDirectorFactoryConfig = new ScoreDirectorFactoryConfig();
        scoreDirectorFactoryConfig.setScoreDefinitionType(ScoreDirectorFactoryConfig.ScoreDefinitionType.SIMPLE);
        scoreDirectorFactoryConfig.setScoreDrlList(
                Arrays.asList("/org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nQueensScoreRules.drl"));
        solverConfig.setScoreDirectorFactoryConfig(scoreDirectorFactoryConfig);

        TerminationConfig terminationConfig = new TerminationConfig();
        // ...
        solverConfig.setTerminationConfig(terminationConfig);
        List&lt;SolverPhaseConfig&gt; solverPhaseConfigList = new ArrayList&lt;SolverPhaseConfig&gt;();
        ConstructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig constructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig
                = new ConstructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig();
        // ...
        solverPhaseConfigList.add(constructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig);
        LocalSearchSolverPhaseConfig localSearchSolverPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchSolverPhaseConfig();
        // ...
        solverPhaseConfigList.add(localSearchSolverPhaseConfig);
        solverConfig.setSolverPhaseConfigList(solverPhaseConfigList);
        Solver solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();</programlisting>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">It is highly recommended to configure by XML file instead of this API.</emphasis> To
      dynamically configure a value at runtime, use the XML file as a template and extract the
      <literal>SolverConfig</literal> class with <literal>getSolverConfig()</literal> to configure the dynamic value at
      runtime:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">        XmlSolverFactory solverFactory = new XmlSolverFactory();
                "/org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");

        SolverConfig solverConfig = solverFactory.getSolverConfig();
        solverConfig.getTerminationConfig().setMaximumMinutesSpend(userInput);
        Solver solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();</programlisting>

  <section>
    <title>Model your planning problem</title>

    <section>
      <title>Is this class a problem fact or planning entity?</title>

      <para>Look at a dataset of your planning problem. You 'll recognize domain classes in there, each of which is one
      of these:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A unrelated class: not used by any of the score constraints. From a planning standpoint, this data is
          obsolete.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <emphasis role="bold">problem fact</emphasis> class: used by the score constraints, but does NOT
          change during planning (as long as the problem stays the same). For example: <literal>Bed</literal>,
          <literal>Room</literal>, <literal>Shift</literal>, <literal>Employee</literal>, <literal>Topic</literal>,
          <literal>Period</literal>, ...</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <emphasis role="bold">planning entity</emphasis> class: used by the score constraints and changes
          during planning. For example: <literal>BedDesignation</literal>, <literal>ShiftAssignment</literal>,
          <literal>Exam</literal>, ...</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Ask yourself: <emphasis>What class changes during planning?</emphasis> <emphasis>Which class has variables
      that I want the <literal>Solver</literal> to change for me?</emphasis> That class is a planning entity. Most use
      cases have only 1 planning entity class.</para>

      <note>
        <para>In <link linkend="realTimePlanning">real-time planning</link>, problem facts can change during planning,
        because the problem itself changes. However, that doesn't make them planning entities.</para>
      </note>

      <para>A good model can greatly improve the success of your planning implementation. For inspiration, take a look
      at how the examples modeled their domain:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Planner_configuration/entityVariableAndValueExamples.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>When in doubt, it's usually the many side of a many to one relationship that is the planning entity. For
      example in employee rostering, the planning entity class is <literal>ShiftAssignment</literal>, not
      <literal>Employee</literal>. Vehicle routing is special, because it uses a <link
      linkend="chainedPlanningVariable">chained planning variable</link>.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">In OptaPlanner all problems facts and planning entities are plain old JavaBeans
      (POJO's).</emphasis> You can load them from a database (JDBC/JPA/JDO), an XML file, a data repository, a noSQL
      cloud, ...: OptaPlanner doesn't care.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="problemFact">
      <title>Problem fact</title>

      <para>A problem fact is any JavaBean (POJO) with getters that does not change during planning. Implementing the
      interface <literal>Serializable</literal> is recommended (but not required). For example in n queens, the columns
      and rows are problem facts:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class Column implements Serializable {

    private int index;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <programlisting language="java">public class Row implements Serializable {

    private int index;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <para>A problem fact can reference other problem facts of course:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class Course implements Serializable {

    private String code;

    private Teacher teacher; // Other problem fact
    private int lectureSize;
    private int minWorkingDaySize;

    private List&lt;Curriculum&gt; curriculumList; // Other problem facts
    private int studentSize;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <para>A problem fact class does <emphasis>not</emphasis> require any Planner specific code. For example, you can
      reuse your domain classes, which might have JPA annotations.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Generally, better designed domain classes lead to simpler and more efficient score constraints. Therefore,
        when dealing with a messy legacy system, it can sometimes be worth it to convert the messy domain set into a
        planner specific POJO set first. For example: if your domain model has 2 <literal>Teacher</literal> instances
        for the same teacher that teaches at 2 different departments, it's hard to write a correct score constraint that
        constrains a teacher's spare time.</para>

        <para>Alternatively, you can sometimes also introduce <link linkend="cachedProblemFact"><emphasis>a cached
        problem fact</emphasis></link> to enrich the domain model for planning only.</para>
      </note>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="planningEntity">
      <title>Planning entity</title>

      <section>
        <title>Planning entity annotation</title>

        <para>A planning entity is a JavaBean (POJO) that changes during solving, for example a <literal>Queen</literal>
        that changes to another row. A planning problem has multiple planning entities, for example for a single n
        queens problem, each <literal>Queen</literal> is a planning entity. But there's usually only 1 planning entity
        class, for example the <literal>Queen</literal> class.</para>

        <para>A planning entity class needs to be annotated with the <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal>
        annotation.</para>

        <para>Each planning entity class has 1 or more <emphasis>planning variables</emphasis>. It usually also has 1 or
        more <emphasis>defining</emphasis> properties. For example in n queens, a <literal>Queen</literal> is defined by
        its <literal>Column</literal> and has a planning variable <literal>Row</literal>. This means that a Queen's
        column never changes during solving, while its row does change.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity
public class Queen {

    private Column column;

    // Planning variables: changes during planning, between score calculations.
    private Row row;

    // ... getters and setters
}</programlisting>

        <para>A planning entity class can have multiple planning variables. For example, a <literal>Lecture</literal> is
        defined by its <literal>Course</literal> and its index in that course (because 1 course has multiple lectures).
        Each <literal>Lecture</literal> needs to be scheduled into a <literal>Period</literal> and a
        <literal>Room</literal> so it has 2 planning variables (period and room). For example: the course Mathematics
        has 8 lectures per week, of which the first lecture is Monday morning at 08:00 in room 212.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity
public class Lecture {

    private Course course;
    private int lectureIndexInCourse;

    // Planning variables: changes during planning, between score calculations.
    private Period period;
    private Room room;

    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The solver configuration also needs to be made aware of each planning entity class:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">&lt;solver&gt;
  ...
  &lt;planningEntityClass&gt;org.optaplanner.examples.nqueens.domain.Queen&lt;/planningEntityClass&gt;
  ...
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Some uses cases have multiple planning entity classes. For example: route freight and trains into railway
        network arcs, where each freight can use multiple trains over its journey and each train can carry multiple
        freights per arc. Having multiple planning entity classes directly raises the implementation complexity of your
        use case.</para>

        <note>
          <para><emphasis>Do not create unnecessary planning entity classes.</emphasis> This leads to difficult
          <literal>Move</literal> implementations and slower score calculation.</para>

          <para>For example, do not create a planning entity class to hold the total free time of a teacher, which needs
          to be kept up to date as the <literal>Lecture</literal> planning entities change. Instead, calculate the free
          time in the score constraints and put the result per teacher into a logically inserted score object.</para>

          <para>If historic data needs to be considered too, then create problem fact to hold the historic data up to,
          but <emphasis>not including</emphasis>, the planning window (so it doesn't change when a planning entity
          changes) and let the score constraints take it into account.</para>
        </note>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="planningEntityDifficulty">
        <title>Planning entity difficulty</title>

        <para>Some optimization algorithms work more efficiently if they have an estimation of which planning entities
        are more difficult to plan. For example: in bin packing bigger items are harder to fit, in course scheduling
        lectures with more students are more difficult to schedule and in n queens the middle queens are more difficult
        to fit on the board.</para>

        <para>Therefore, you can set a <literal>difficultyComparatorClass</literal> to the
        <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal> annotation:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity(difficultyComparatorClass = CloudProcessDifficultyComparator.class)
public class CloudProcess {
    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <programlisting language="java">public class CloudProcessDifficultyComparator implements Comparator&lt;CloudProcess&gt; {

    public int compare(CloudProcess a, CloudProcess b) {
        return new CompareToBuilder()
                .append(a.getRequiredMultiplicand(), b.getRequiredMultiplicand())
                .append(a.getId(), b.getId())
                .toComparison();
    }

}</programlisting>

        <para>Alternatively, you can also set a <literal>difficultyWeightFactoryClass</literal> to the
        <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal> annotation, so you have access to the rest of the problem facts from the
        <literal>Solution</literal> too:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity(difficultyWeightFactoryClass = QueenDifficultyWeightFactory.class)
public class Queen {
    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>See <link linkend="sortedSelection">Sorted Selection</link> for more information.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Difficulty should be implemented ascending: easy entities are lower, difficult entities are higher. For
          example in bin packing: small item &lt; medium item &lt; big item.</para>

          <para>Even though some algorithms start with the more difficult entities first, they just reverse the
          ordering.</para>
        </important>

        <para><emphasis>None of the current planning variable state should be used to compare planning entity
        difficult.</emphasis> During construction heuristics, those variables are likely to be <literal>null</literal>
        anyway. For example, a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>row</literal> variable should not be used.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="planningVariable">
      <title>Planning variable</title>

      <section>
        <title>Planning variable annotation</title>

        <para>A planning variable is a property (including getter and setter) on a planning entity. It points to a
        planning value, which changes during planning. For example, a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>row</literal>
        property is a planning variable. Note that even though a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>row</literal>
        property changes to another <literal>Row</literal> during planning, no <literal>Row</literal> instance itself is
        changed.</para>

        <para>A planning variable getter needs to be annotated with the <literal>@PlanningVariable</literal> annotation,
        which needs a non-empty <literal>valueRangeProviderRefs</literal> property.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity
public class Queen {

    private Row row;

    // ...

    @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = {"rowRange"})
    public Row getRow() {
        return row;
    }

    public void setRow(Row row) {
        this.row = row;
    }

}</programlisting>

        <para>The <literal>valueRangeProviderRefs</literal> property defines what are the possible planning values for
        this planning variable. It references 1 or more <literal>@ValueRangeProvider</literal>
        <literal>id</literal>'s.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="nullablePlanningVariable">
        <title>Nullable planning variable</title>

        <para>By default, an initialized planning variable cannot be <literal>null</literal>, so an initialized solution
        will never use <literal>null</literal> for any of its planning variables. In an over-constrained use case, this
        can be contra productive. For example: in task assignment with too many tasks for the workforce, we would rather
        leave low priority tasks unassigned instead of assigning them to an overloaded worker.</para>

        <para>To allow an initialized planning variable to be <literal>null</literal>, set <literal>nullable</literal>
        to <literal>true</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">    @PlanningVariable(..., nullable = true)
    public Worker getWorker() {
        return worker;
    }</programlisting>

        <important>
          <para>Planner will automatically add the value <literal>null</literal> to the value range. There is no need to
          add <literal>null</literal> in a collection used by a <literal>ValueRangeProvider</literal>.</para>
        </important>

        <note>
          <para>Using a nullable planning variable implies that your score calculation is responsible for punishing (or
          even rewarding) variables with a null value.</para>
        </note>

        <para><link linkend="repeatedPlanning">Repeated planning</link> (especially <link
        linkend="realTimePlanning">real-time planning</link>) does not mix well with a nullable planning variable: every
        time the Solver starts or a problem fact change is made, the construction heuristics will try to initialize all
        the null variables again, which can be a huge waste of time. One way to deal with this, is to change when a
        planning entity should be reinitialized with an <literal>reinitializeVariableEntityFilter</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">    @PlanningVariable(..., nullable = true, reinitializeVariableEntityFilter = ReinitializeTaskFilter.class)
    public Worker getWorker() {

    }</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>When is a planning variable considered initialized?</title>

        <para>A planning variable is considered initialized if its value is not <literal>null</literal> or if the
        variable is <literal>nullable</literal>. So a nullable variable is always considered initialized, even when a
        custom <literal>reinitializeVariableEntityFilter</literal> triggers a reinitialization during construction
        heuristics.</para>

        <para>A planning entity is initialized if all of its planning variables are initialized.</para>

        <para>A <literal>Solution</literal> is initialized if all of its planning entities are initialized.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Planning value and planning value ranges</title>

      <section>
        <title>Planning value</title>

        <para>A planning value is a possible value for a planning variable. Usually, a planning value is a problem fact,
        but it can also be any object, for example a double. It can even be another planning entity or even a interface
        implemented by a planning entity and a problem fact.</para>

        <para>A planning value range is the set of possible planning values for a planning variable. This set can be a
        discrete (for example row <literal>1</literal>, <literal>2</literal>, <literal>3</literal> or
        <literal>4</literal>) or continuous (for example any <literal>double</literal> between <literal>0.0</literal>
        and <literal>1.0</literal>).</para>

        <para>There are several ways to define the value range of a planning variable with the
        <literal>@ValueRangeProvider</literal> annotation. A <literal>@ValueRangeProvider</literal> annotation always
        has a property <literal>id</literal>, which is referenced by the <literal>@PlanningVariable</literal>'s
        property <literal>valueRangeProviderRefs</literal>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Planning value range provider</title>

        <section xml:id="valueRangeProviderOnSolution">
          <title><literal>ValueRangeProvider</literal> on a <literal>Solution</literal></title>

          <para>All instances of the same planning entity class share the same set of possible planning values for that
          planning variable. This is the most common way to configure a value range.</para>

          <para>The <literal>Solution</literal> implementation has method which returns a
          <literal>Collection</literal>. Any value from that <literal>Collection</literal> is a possible planning value
          for this planning variable.</para>

          <para>Each planning entity has its own set of possible planning values for a planning variable. For example,

          <para>Never use this to enforce a soft constraint (or even a hard constraint when the problem might not have a

          <note>
            <para>By limiting the value range specifically of 1 planning entity, you are effectively creating a
            <emphasis>build-in hard constraint</emphasis>. This can be a very good thing, as the number of possible

          <para>A planning entity should <emphasis>not</emphasis> use other planning entities to determinate its value

        <title>Planning value strength</title>

        <para>Some optimization algorithms work more efficiently if they have an estimation of which planning values are

        student capacity constraint.</para>

        <para>Therefore, you can set a <literal>strengthComparatorClass</literal> to the

}</programlisting>

        <note>
          <para>If you have multiple planning value classes in the <emphasis>same</emphasis> value range, the

          of those different classes.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Alternatively, you can also set a <literal>strengthWeightFactoryClass</literal> to the

        <para>See <link linkend="sortedSelection">Sorted Selection</link> for more information.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Strength should be implemented ascending: weaker values are lower, stronger values are higher. For

        </important>

        <para><emphasis>None of the current planning variable state in any of the planning entities should be used to

        <para>A dataset for a planning problem needs to be wrapped in a class for the <literal>Solver</literal> to

        list.</para>

        <para>A planning problem is actually a unsolved planning solution or - stated differently - an uninitialized
        <literal>Solution</literal>. Therefor, that wrapping class must implement the <literal>Solution</literal>
        interface. For example in n queens, that <literal>NQueens</literal> class implements
        <literal>Solution</literal>, yet every <literal>Queen</literal> in a fresh <literal>NQueens</literal> class is
        not yet assigned to a <literal>Row</literal> (their <literal>row</literal> property is <literal>null</literal>).
        So it's not a feasible solution. It's not even a possible solution. It's an uninitialized solution.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The <literal>Solution</literal> interface</title>

        <para>You need to present the problem as a <literal>Solution</literal> instance to the

        <title>The <literal>getScore()</literal> and <literal>setScore()</literal> methods</title>

        <para>A <literal>Solution</literal> requires a score property. The score property is <literal>null</literal> if

      <para>If instead, you're still using Log4J (and you don't want to switch to its faster successor, Logback), add
      the bridge dependency:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-log4j12&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.x&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>And configure the logging level on the package <literal>org.optaplanner</literal> in your
      <filename>log4j.xml</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;log4j:configuration xmlns:log4j="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/"&gt;

  &lt;category name="org.optaplanner"&gt;
    &lt;priority value="debug" /&gt;
