    <section>
      <title>Solver configuration by XML file</title>

      <para>You can build a <literal>Solver</literal> instance with the <literal>XmlSolverFactory</literal>. Configure
      it with a solver configuration XML file:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">       XmlSolverFactory solverFactory = new XmlSolverFactory(
               "/org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");
       Solver solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();</programlisting>

      <para>A solver configuration file looks something like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;solver&gt;
  &lt;!-- Define the model --&gt;
  &lt;solutionClass&gt;org.optaplanner.examples.nqueens.domain.NQueens&lt;/solutionClass&gt;
  &lt;planningEntityClass&gt;org.optaplanner.examples.nqueens.domain.Queen&lt;/planningEntityClass&gt;

  &lt;!-- Define the score function --&gt;
  &lt;scoreDirectorFactory&gt;
    &lt;scoreDefinitionType&gt;SIMPLE&lt;/scoreDefinitionType&gt;
    &lt;scoreDrl&gt;/org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nQueensScoreRules.drl&lt;/scoreDrl&gt;
  &lt;/scoreDirectorFactory&gt;

  &lt;!-- Configure the optimization algorithm(s) --&gt;
  &lt;termination&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/termination&gt;
  &lt;constructionHeuristic&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/constructionHeuristic&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Notice the 3 parts in it:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Define the model</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Configure the optimization algorithm(s)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>We'll explain these various parts of a configuration later in this manual.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">OptaPlanner makes it relatively easy to switch optimization algorithm(s) just by
      changing the configuration.</emphasis> There's even a <literal>Benchmark</literal> utility which allows you to
      play out different configurations against each other and report the most appropriate configuration for your
      problem. You could for example play out tabu search versus simulated annealing, on 4 queens and 64 queens.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Solver configuration by Java API</title>

      <para>As an alternative to the XML file, a solver configuration can also be configured with the
      <literal>SolverConfig</literal> API:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">        SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig();

        solverConfig.setSolutionClass(NQueens.class);
        solverConfig.setPlanningEntityClassSet(Collections.&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt;singleton(Queen.class));

        ScoreDirectorFactoryConfig scoreDirectorFactoryConfig = new ScoreDirectorFactoryConfig();
        scoreDirectorFactoryConfig.setScoreDefinitionType(ScoreDirectorFactoryConfig.ScoreDefinitionType.SIMPLE);
        scoreDirectorFactoryConfig.setScoreDrlList(
                Arrays.asList("/org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nQueensScoreRules.drl"));
        solverConfig.setScoreDirectorFactoryConfig(scoreDirectorFactoryConfig);

        TerminationConfig terminationConfig = new TerminationConfig();
        // ...
        solverConfig.setTerminationConfig(terminationConfig);
        List&lt;SolverPhaseConfig&gt; solverPhaseConfigList = new ArrayList&lt;SolverPhaseConfig&gt;();
        ConstructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig constructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig
                = new ConstructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig();
        // ...
        solverPhaseConfigList.add(constructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig);
        LocalSearchSolverPhaseConfig localSearchSolverPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchSolverPhaseConfig();
        // ...
        solverPhaseConfigList.add(localSearchSolverPhaseConfig);
        solverConfig.setSolverPhaseConfigList(solverPhaseConfigList);
        Solver solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();</programlisting>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">It is highly recommended to configure by XML file instead of this API.</emphasis> To
      dynamically configure a value at runtime, use the XML file as a template and extract the
      <literal>SolverConfig</literal> class with <literal>getSolverConfig()</literal> to configure the dynamic value at
      runtime:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">        XmlSolverFactory solverFactory = new XmlSolverFactory();
                "/org/optaplanner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");

        SolverConfig solverConfig = solverFactory.getSolverConfig();
        solverConfig.getTerminationConfig().setMaximumMinutesSpend(userInput);
        Solver solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();</programlisting>

  <section>
    <title>Model your planning problem</title>

    <section>
      <title>Is this class a problem fact or planning entity?</title>

      <para>Look at a dataset of your planning problem. You 'll recognize domain classes in there, each of which is one
      of these:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A unrelated class: not used by any of the score constraints. From a planning standpoint, this data is
          obsolete.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <emphasis role="bold">problem fact</emphasis> class: used by the score constraints, but does NOT
          change during planning (as long as the problem stays the same). For example: <literal>Bed</literal>,
          <literal>Room</literal>, <literal>Shift</literal>, <literal>Employee</literal>, <literal>Topic</literal>,
          <literal>Period</literal>, ...</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <emphasis role="bold">planning entity</emphasis> class: used by the score constraints and changes
          during planning. For example: <literal>BedDesignation</literal>, <literal>ShiftAssignment</literal>,
          <literal>Exam</literal>, ...</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Ask yourself: <emphasis>What class changes during planning?</emphasis> <emphasis>Which class has variables
      that I want the <literal>Solver</literal> to change for me?</emphasis> That class is a planning entity. Most use
      cases have only 1 planning entity class.</para>

      <note>
        <para>In <link linkend="realTimePlanning">real-time planning</link>, problem facts can change during planning,
        because the problem itself changes. However, that doesn't make them planning entities.</para>
      </note>

      <para>A good model can greatly improve the success of your planning implementation. For inspiration, take a look
      at how the examples modeled their domain:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Planner_configuration/entityVariableAndValueExamples.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>When in doubt, it's usually the many side of a many to one relationship that is the planning entity. For
      example in employee rostering, the planning entity class is <literal>ShiftAssignment</literal>, not
      <literal>Employee</literal>. Vehicle routing is special, because it uses a <link
      linkend="chainedPlanningVariable">chained planning variable</link>.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">In OptaPlanner all problems facts and planning entities are plain old JavaBeans
      (POJO's).</emphasis> You can load them from a database (JDBC/JPA/JDO), an XML file, a data repository, a noSQL
      cloud, ...: OptaPlanner doesn't care.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="problemFact">
      <title>Problem fact</title>

      <para>A problem fact is any JavaBean (POJO) with getters that does not change during planning. Implementing the
      interface <literal>Serializable</literal> is recommended (but not required). For example in n queens, the columns
      and rows are problem facts:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class Column implements Serializable {

    private int index;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <programlisting language="java">public class Row implements Serializable {

    private int index;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <para>A problem fact can reference other problem facts of course:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class Course implements Serializable {

    private String code;

    private Teacher teacher; // Other problem fact
    private int lectureSize;
    private int minWorkingDaySize;

    private List&lt;Curriculum&gt; curriculumList; // Other problem facts
    private int studentSize;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <para>A problem fact class does <emphasis>not</emphasis> require any Planner specific code. For example, you can
      reuse your domain classes, which might have JPA annotations.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Generally, better designed domain classes lead to simpler and more efficient score constraints. Therefore,
        when dealing with a messy legacy system, it can sometimes be worth it to convert the messy domain set into a
        planner specific POJO set first. For example: if your domain model has 2 <literal>Teacher</literal> instances
        for the same teacher that teaches at 2 different departments, it's hard to write a correct score constraint that
        constrains a teacher's spare time.</para>

        <para>Alternatively, you can sometimes also introduce <link linkend="cachedProblemFact"><emphasis>a cached
        problem fact</emphasis></link> to enrich the domain model for planning only.</para>
      </note>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Planning entity and planning variables</title>

      <section xml:id="planningEntity">
        <title>Planning entity</title>

        <para>A planning entity is a JavaBean (POJO) that changes during solving, for example a <literal>Queen</literal>
        that changes to another row. A planning problem has multiple planning entities, for example for a single n
        queens problem, each <literal>Queen</literal> is a planning entity. But there's usually only 1 planning entity
        class, for example the <literal>Queen</literal> class.</para>

        <para>A planning entity class needs to be annotated with the <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal>
        annotation.</para>

        <para>Each planning entity class has 1 or more <emphasis>planning variables</emphasis>. It usually also has 1 or
        more <emphasis>defining</emphasis> properties. For example in n queens, a <literal>Queen</literal> is defined by
        its <literal>Column</literal> and has a planning variable <literal>Row</literal>. This means that a Queen's
        column never changes during solving, while its row does change.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity
public class Queen {

    private Column column;

    // Planning variables: changes during planning, between score calculations.
    private Row row;

    // ... getters and setters
}</programlisting>

        <para>A planning entity class can have multiple planning variables. For example, a <literal>Lecture</literal> is
        defined by its <literal>Course</literal> and its index in that course (because 1 course has multiple lectures).
        Each <literal>Lecture</literal> needs to be scheduled into a <literal>Period</literal> and a
        <literal>Room</literal> so it has 2 planning variables (period and room). For example: the course Mathematics
        has 8 lectures per week, of which the first lecture is Monday morning at 08:00 in room 212.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity
public class Lecture {

    private Course course;
    private int lectureIndexInCourse;

    // Planning variables: changes during planning, between score calculations.
    private Period period;
    private Room room;

    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The solver configuration also needs to be made aware of each planning entity class:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">&lt;solver&gt;
  ...
  &lt;planningEntityClass&gt;org.optaplanner.examples.nqueens.domain.Queen&lt;/planningEntityClass&gt;
  ...
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Some uses cases have multiple planning entity classes. For example: route freight and trains into railway
        network arcs, where each freight can use multiple trains over its journey and each train can carry multiple
        freights per arc. Having multiple planning entity classes directly raises the implementation complexity of your
        use case.</para>

        <note>
          <para><emphasis>Do not create unnecessary planning entity classes.</emphasis> This leads to difficult
          <literal>Move</literal> implementations and slower score calculation.</para>

          <para>For example, do not create a planning entity class to hold the total free time of a teacher, which needs
          to be kept up to date as the <literal>Lecture</literal> planning entities change. Instead, calculate the free
          time in the score constraints and put the result per teacher into a logically inserted score object.</para>

          <para>If historic data needs to be considered too, then create problem fact to hold the historic data up to,
          but <emphasis>not including</emphasis>, the planning window (so it doesn't change when a planning entity
          changes) and let the score constraints take it into account.</para>
        </note>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="planningEntityDifficulty">
        <title>Planning entity difficulty</title>

        <para>Some optimization algorithms work more efficiently if they have an estimation of which planning entities
        are more difficult to plan. For example: in bin packing bigger items are harder to fit, in course scheduling
        lectures with more students are more difficult to schedule and in n queens the middle queens are more difficult
        to fit on the board.</para>

        <para>Therefore, you can set a <literal>difficultyComparatorClass</literal> to the
        <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal> annotation:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity(difficultyComparatorClass = CloudProcessDifficultyComparator.class)
public class CloudProcess {
    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <programlisting language="java">public class CloudProcessDifficultyComparator implements Comparator&lt;CloudProcess&gt; {

    public int compare(CloudProcess a, CloudProcess b) {
        return new CompareToBuilder()
                .append(a.getRequiredMultiplicand(), b.getRequiredMultiplicand())
                .append(a.getId(), b.getId())
                .toComparison();
    }

}</programlisting>

        <para>Alternatively, you can also set a <literal>difficultyWeightFactoryClass</literal> to the
        <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal> annotation, so you have access to the rest of the problem facts from the
        <literal>Solution</literal> too:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity(difficultyWeightFactoryClass = QueenDifficultyWeightFactory.class)
public class Queen {
    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>See <link linkend="sortedSelection">Sorted Selection</link> for more information.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Difficulty should be implemented ascending: easy entities are lower, difficult entities are higher. For
          example in bin packing: small item &lt; medium item &lt; big item.</para>

          <para>Even though some algorithms start with the more difficult entities first, they just reverse the
          ordering.</para>
        </important>

        <para><emphasis>None of the current planning variable state should be used to compare planning entity
        difficult.</emphasis> During construction heuristics, those variables are likely to be <literal>null</literal>
        anyway. For example, a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>row</literal> variable should not be used.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Planning variable</title>

        <para>A planning variable is a property (including getter and setter) on a planning entity. It points to a
        planning value, which changes during planning. For example, a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>row</literal>
        property is a planning variable. Note that even though a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>row</literal>
        property changes to another <literal>Row</literal> during planning, no <literal>Row</literal> instance itself is
        changed.</para>

        <para>A planning variable getter needs to be annotated with the <literal>@PlanningVariable</literal> annotation.
        Furthermore, it needs a <literal>@ValueRange</literal> annotation too.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">@PlanningEntity
public class Queen {

    private Row row;

    // ...

    @PlanningVariable
    @ValueRange(type = ValueRangeType.FROM_SOLUTION_PROPERTY, solutionProperty = rowList")
    public Row getRow() {
        return row;
    }

    public void setRow(Row row) {
        this.row = row;
    }

}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="nullablePlanningVariable">
        <title>Nullable planning variable</title>

        <para>By default, an initialized planning variable cannot be <literal>null</literal>, so an initialized solution
        will never use <literal>null</literal> for any of its planning variables. In over-constrained use case, this can
        be contra productive. For example: in task assignment with too many tasks for the workforce, we would rather
        leave low priority tasks unassigned instead of assigning them to an overloaded worker.</para>

        <para>To allow an initialized planning variable to be <literal>null</literal>, set <literal>nullable</literal>
        to <literal>true</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">    @PlanningVariable(nullable = true)
    @ValueRange(...)
    public Worker getWorker() {
        return worker;
    }</programlisting>

        <important>
          <para>Planner will automatically add the value <literal>null</literal> to the value range. There is no need to
          add <literal>null</literal> in a collection used by a <literal>ValueRange</literal>.</para>
        </important>

        <note>
          <para>Using a nullable planning variable implies that your score calculation is responsible for punishing (or
          even rewarding) variables with a null value.</para>
        </note>

        <para><link linkend="repeatedPlanning">Repeated planning</link> (especially <link
        linkend="realTimePlanning">real-time planning</link>) does not mix well with a nullable planning variable: every
        time the Solver starts or a problem fact change is made, the construction heuristics will try to initialize all
        the null variables again, which can be a huge waste of time. One way to deal with this, is to change when a
        planning entity should be reinitialized with an <literal>reinitializeVariableEntityFilter</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">    @PlanningVariable(nullable = true, reinitializeVariableEntityFilter = ReinitializeTaskFilter.class)
    @ValueRange(...)
    public Worker getWorker() {
        return worker;
    }</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>When is a planning variable considered initialized?</title>

        <para>A planning variable is considered initialized if its value is not <literal>null</literal> or if the
        variable is <literal>nullable</literal>. So a nullable variable is always considered initialized, even when a
        custom <literal>reinitializeVariableEntityFilter</literal> triggers a reinitialization.</para>

        <para>A planning entity is initialized if all of its planning variables are initialized.</para>

        <para>A <literal>Solution</literal> is initialized if all of its planning entities are initialized.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Planning value and planning value ranges</title>

      <section>
        <title>Planning value</title>

        <para>A planning value is a possible value for a planning variable. Usually, a planning value is a problem fact,
        but it can also be any object, for example a double. It can even be another planning entity or even a interface
        implemented by a planning entity and a problem fact.</para>

        <para>A planning value range is the set of possible planning values for a planning variable. This set can be a
        discrete (for example row <literal>1</literal>, <literal>2</literal>, <literal>3</literal> or
        <literal>4</literal>) or continuous (for example any <literal>double</literal> between <literal>0.0</literal>
        and <literal>1.0</literal>). Continuous planning variables are currently undersupported and require the use of
        custom moves.</para>

        <para>There are several ways to define the value range of a planning variable with the
        <literal>@ValueRange</literal> annotation.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Planning value range</title>

        <section>
          <title><literal>ValueRange</literal> from <literal>Solution</literal> property</title>

          <para>All instances of the same planning entity class share the same set of possible planning values for that
          planning variable. This is the most common way to configure a value range.</para>

          <para>The <literal>Solution</literal> implementation has property which returns a
          <literal>Collection</literal>. Any value from that <literal>Collection</literal> is a possible planning value
          for this planning variable.</para>

          <programlisting language="java">    @PlanningVariable
    @ValueRange(type = ValueRangeType.FROM_SOLUTION_PROPERTY, solutionProperty = "rowList")
    public Row getRow() {
        return row;
    }</programlisting>

          <programlisting language="java">public class NQueens implements Solution&lt;SimpleScore&gt; {

    // ...

    public List&lt;Row&gt; getRowList() {
        return rowList;
    }

          <para>Each planning entity has its own set of possible planning values for a planning variable. For example,
          if a teacher can <emphasis role="bold">never</emphasis> teach in a room that does not belong to his
          department, lectures of that teacher can limit their room value range to the rooms of his department.</para>

          <para>Never use this to enforce a soft constraint (or even a hard constraint when the problem might not have a

          <note>
            <para>By limiting the value range specifically of 1 planning entity, you are effectively making a
            <emphasis>build-in hard constraint</emphasis>. This can be a very good thing, as the number of possible
            solutions is severely lowered. But this can also be a bad thing because it takes away the freedom of the

      <section xml:id="planningValueStrength">
        <title>Planning value strength</title>

        <para>Some optimization algorithms work more efficiently if they have an estimation of which planning values are

        student capacity constraint.</para>

        <para>Therefore, you can set a <literal>strengthComparatorClass</literal> to the

}</programlisting>

        <note>
          <para>If you have multiple planning value classes in the <emphasis>same</emphasis> value range, the
          <literal>strengthComparatorClass</literal> needs to implement a <literal>Comparator</literal> of a common

          of those different classes.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Alternatively, you can also set a <literal>strengthWeightFactoryClass</literal> to the

        solution too:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">    @PlanningVariable(strengthWeightFactoryClass = RowStrengthWeightFactory.class)

        <para>See <link linkend="sortedSelection">Sorted Selection</link> for more information.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Strength should be implemented ascending: weaker values are lower, stronger values are higher. For

        </important>

        <para><emphasis>None of the current planning variable state in any of the planning entities should be used to

        <literal>null</literal> anyway. For example, none of the <literal>row</literal> variables of any

      <title>Planning problem and planning solution</title>

      <section>
        <title>Planning problem instance</title>

        <para>A dataset for a planning problem needs to be wrapped in a class for the <literal>Solver</literal> to
        solve. You must implement this class. For example in n queens, this in the <literal>NQueens</literal> class
        which contains a <literal>Column</literal> list, a <literal>Row</literal> list and a <literal>Queen</literal>
        list.</para>

        <para>A planning problem is actually a unsolved planning solution or - stated differently - an uninitialized
        <literal>Solution</literal>. Therefor, that wrapping class must implement the <literal>Solution</literal>
        interface. For example in n queens, that <literal>NQueens</literal> class implements
        <literal>Solution</literal>, yet every <literal>Queen</literal> in a fresh <literal>NQueens</literal> class is
        not yet assigned to a <literal>Row</literal> (their <literal>row</literal> property is <literal>null</literal>).
        So it's not a feasible solution. It's not even a possible solution. It's an uninitialized solution.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The <literal>Solution</literal> interface</title>

        <para>You need to present the problem as a <literal>Solution</literal> instance to the
        <literal>Solver</literal>. So you need to have a class that implements the <literal>Solution</literal>
        interface:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">public interface Solution&lt;S extends Score&gt; {

    S getScore();
    void setScore(S score);

    Collection&lt;? extends Object&gt; getProblemFacts();

}</programlisting>

        <para>For example, an <literal>NQueens</literal> instance holds a list of all columns, all rows and all
        <literal>Queen</literal> instances:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">public class NQueens implements Solution&lt;SimpleScore&gt; {

    private int n;

    // Problem facts
    private List&lt;Column&gt; columnList;

      <section>
        <title>The <literal>getScore()</literal> and <literal>setScore()</literal> methods</title>

        <para>A <literal>Solution</literal> requires a score property. The score property is <literal>null</literal> if
        the <literal>Solution</literal> is uninitialized or if the score has not yet been (re)calculated. The
        <literal>score</literal> property is usually typed to the specific <literal>Score</literal> implementation you
        use. For example, <literal>NQueens</literal> uses a <literal>SimpleScore</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">public class NQueens implements Solution&lt;SimpleScore&gt; {

    private SimpleScore score;

    public SimpleScore getScore() {
        return score;
    }

    public void setScore(SimpleScore score) {
        this.score = score;
    }

    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Most use cases use a <literal>HardSoftScore</literal> instead:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">public class CourseSchedule implements Solution&lt;HardSoftScore&gt; {

    private HardSoftScore score;

    public HardSoftScore getScore() {
        return score;

    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {
        this.score = score;
    }

    Solution bestSolution = solver.getBestSolution();</programlisting>

      <para>For example in n queens, the method <literal>getBestSolution()</literal> will return an

      <para>The <literal>solve()</literal> method can take a long time (depending on the problem size and the solver

      <title>Environment mode: Are there bugs in my code?</title>

      <para>The environment mode allows you to detect common bugs in your implementation. It does not affect the logging
      level.</para>

      <para>You can set the environment mode in the solver configuration XML file:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;solver&gt;
  &lt;environmentMode&gt;FAST_ASSERT&lt;/environmentMode&gt;
  ...
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>A solver has a single <literal>Random</literal> instance. Some solver configurations use the
      <literal>Random</literal> instance a lot more than others. For example simulated annealing depends highly on
      random numbers, while tabu search only depends on it to deal with score ties. The environment mode influences the
      seed of that <literal>Random</literal> instance.</para>

      <para>There are 4 environment modes:</para>

      <section>
        <title>FULL_ASSERT</title>

        <para>The FULL_ASSERT mode turns on all assertions (such as
        assert that the incremental score calculation is uncorrupted for each move) to fail-fast on a bug in a Move
        implementation, a score rule, the rule engine itself, ...</para>

        <para>This mode is reproducible (see the reproducible mode). It is also intrusive because it calls the method
        <literal>calculateScore()</literal> more frequently than a non assert mode.</para>

        <para>The FULL_ASSERT mode is horribly slow (because it doesn't rely on delta based score calculation).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>NON_INTRUSIVE_FULL_ASSERT</title>

        <para>The NON_INTRUSIVE_FULL_ASSERT turns on several
        assertions to fail-fast on a bug in a Move implementation, a score rule, the rule engine itself, ...</para>

        <para>This mode is reproducible (see the reproducible mode). It is non-intrusive because it does not call the
        method <literal>calculateScore()</literal> more frequently than a non assert mode.</para>

        <para>The NON_INTRUSIVE_FULL_ASSERT mode is horribly slow (because it doesn't rely on delta based score
        calculation).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>FAST_ASSERT</title>

        <para>The FAST_ASSERT mode turns on most assertions (such
        as assert that an undo Move's score is the same as before the Move) to fail-fast on a bug in a Move
        implementation, a score rule, the rule engine itself, ...</para>

        <para>This mode is reproducible (see the reproducible mode). It is also intrusive because it calls the method
        <literal>calculateScore()</literal> more frequently than a non assert mode.</para>

        <para>The FAST_ASSERT mode is slow.</para>

        <para>It's recommended to write a test case which does a short run of your planning problem with the FAST_ASSERT
        mode on.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>REPRODUCIBLE (default)</title>

        <para>The reproducible mode is the default mode because it is recommended during development. In this mode, 2
        runs in the same Planner version will execute the same code in the same order. <emphasis role="bold">Those 2
        runs will have the same result</emphasis>, except if the note below applies. This allows you to consistently
        reproduce bugs. It also allows you to benchmark certain refactorings (such as a score constraint optimization)
        fairly across runs.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Despite the reproducible mode, your application might still not be fully reproducible because of:</para>

        <para>The reproducible mode is slightly slower than the production mode. If your production environment requires
        reproducibility, use it in production too.</para>

        <para>In practice, this mode uses the default random seed, and it also disables certain concurrency
        optimizations (such as work stealing).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>PRODUCTION</title>

        <para>The production mode is the fastest, but not reproducible. It is recommended for a
        production environment, unless reproducibility is required.</para>

        <para>The random seed is different on every run, which makes it more robust against an unlucky random seed. An
        unlucky random seed gives a bad result on a certain data set with a certain solver configuration. Note that in
        most use cases the impact of the random seed is relatively low on the result (even with simulated annealing). An
        occasional bad result is far more likely to be caused by another issue (such as a <link
