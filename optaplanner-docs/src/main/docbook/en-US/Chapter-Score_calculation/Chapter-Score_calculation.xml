      <title>What is a Score?</title>

      <para>Every initialized <literal>Solution</literal> has a score. That score is an objective way to compare 2
      solutions: the solution with the higher score is better. The <literal>Solver</literal> aims to find the
      <literal>Solution</literal> with the highest <literal>Score</literal> of all possible solutions. The
      <emphasis>best solution</emphasis> is the <literal>Solution</literal> with the highest <literal>Score</literal>
      that <literal>Solver</literal> has encountered during solving, which might be the <emphasis>optimal
      solution</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Planner cannot automatically know which <literal>Solution</literal> is best for your business, so you need
      to tell it how to calculate the score of a given <literal>Solution</literal> according to your business needs.
      If you forget or unable to implement an important constraint, the solution is probably useless:</para>

      <para>Luckily, Planner is very flexible to define constraints, thanks to these score techniques, which can be
      used and combined as much as needed:</para>

    <section xml:id="scoreConstraintSignum">
      <title>Score Constraint Signum (Positive or Negative)</title>

      <para>All score techniques are based on constraints. Such a constraint can be a simple pattern (such as
      <emphasis>Maximize the apple harvest in the solution</emphasis>) or a more complex pattern. A positive constraint
      is a constraint you're trying to maximize. A negative constraint is a constraint you're trying to minimize.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/positiveAndNegativeConstraints.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Notice in the image above, that the optimal solution always has the highest score, regardless if the
      constraints are positive or negative.</para>

      <para>Most planning problems have only negative constraints and therefore have a negative score. In that case, the
      score is usually the sum of the weight of the negative constraints being broken, with a perfect score of 0. This
      explains why the score of a solution of 4 queens is the negative (and not the positive!) of the number of queen
      pairs which can attack each other.</para>

      <para>Negative and positive constraints can be combined, even in the same score level.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Don't presume your business knows all its score constraints in advance. Expect score constraints to be
        added or changed after the first releases.</para>
      </note>

      <para>When a constraint activates (because the negative constraint is broken or the positive constraint is
      fulfilled) on a certain planning entity set, it is called a <emphasis>constraint match</emphasis>.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="scoreConstraintWeight">
      <title>Score Constraint Weight</title>

      <para>Not all score constraints are equally important. If breaking one constraint is equally bad as breaking
      another constraint x times, then those 2 constraints have a different weight (but they are in the same score
      level). For example in vehicle routing, you can make1 "unhappy driver" constraint match count as much as 2 "fuel
      tank usage" constraint matches:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/scoreWeighting.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Score weighting is often used in use cases where you can put a price tag on everything. In that case, the
      positive constraints maximize revenue and the negative constraints minimize expenses: together they maximize
      profit. Alternatively, score weighting is also often used to create social fairness. For example: a nurse that
      requests a free day pays a higher weight on New Year's eve than on a normal day.</para>

      <para>Put a good weight on a constraint can be a difficult analytical decision, because it's about making choices
      and tradeoffs with other constraints. However, a non-accurate weight is less damaging than not good
      algorithms:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/scoreTradeoffInPerspective.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Furthermore, it is often useful to allow the planning end-user to recalibrate penalty weights in his/her
      user interface, as demonstrated in the exam timetabling example.</para>

      <para>The weight of a constraint match can be dynamically based on the planning entities involved. For example in
      cloud balance: the weight of the soft constraint match for an active <literal>Computer</literal> is the
      <literal>cost</literal> of that <literal>Computer</literal>.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="scoreLevel">
      <title>Score Level</title>

      <para>Sometimes a score constraint outranks another score constraint, no matter how many times the other is
      broken. In that case, those score constraints are in different levels. For example: a nurse cannot do 2 shifts at
      the same time (due to the constraints of physical reality), this outranks all nurse happiness constraints.</para>

      <para>Most use cases have only 2 score levels: hard and soft. When comparing 2 scores, they are compared
      lexicographically: the first score level gets compared first. If those differ, the others score levels are
      ignored. For example: a score that breaks 0 hard constraints and 1000000 soft constraints is better than a score
      that breaks 1 hard constraint and 0 soft constraints.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/scoreLevels.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Score levels often employ score weighting per level. In such case, the hard constraint level usually makes
      the solution feasible and the soft constraint level maximizes profit by weighting the constraints on price.</para>

      <para>Don't use a big constraint weight when your business actually wants different score levels. That hack, known
      as <emphasis>score folding</emphasis>, is broken:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/scoreFoldingIsBroken.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <note>
        <para>Your business will probably tell you that your hard constraints all have the same weight, because they
        cannot be broken (so their weight does not matter). This is not true and it could create a <link
        linkend="scoreTrap">score trap</link>. For example in cloud balance: if a <literal>Computer</literal> has 7 CPU
        too little for its <literal>Process</literal>es, then it must be weighted 7 times as much as if it had only 1
        CPU too little. This way, there is an incentive to move a <literal>Process</literal> with 6 CPU or less away
        from that Computer.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Three or more score levels are also supported. For example: a company might decide that profit outranks
      employee satisfaction (or visa versa), while both are outranked by the constraints of physical reality.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="paretoScoring">
      <title>Pareto Scoring (AKA Multi-objective Optimization Scoring)</title>

      <para>Far less common is the use case of pareto optimization, which is also known under the more confusing term
      multi-objective optimization. In pareto scoring, score constraints are in the same score level, yet they are not
      weighted against each other. When 2 scores are compared, each of the score constraints are compared individually
      and the score with the most dominating score constraints wins. Pareto scoring can even be combined with score
      levels and score constraint weighting.</para>

      <para>Consider this example with positive constraints, where we want to get the most apples and oranges. Since
      it's impossible to compare apples and oranges, we can't weight them against each other. Yet, despite that we can't
      compare them, we can state that 2 apples are better then 1 apple. Similarly, we can state that 2 apples and 1
      orange are better than just 1 orange. So despite our inability to compare some Scores conclusively (at which point
      we declare them equal), we can find a set of optimal scores. Those are called pareto optimal.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/paretoOptimizationScoring.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Scores are considered equal far more often. It's left up to a human to choose the better out of a set of
      best solutions (with equal scores) found by Planner. In the example above, the user must choose between solution A
      (3 apples and 1 orange) and solution B (1 apple and 6 oranges). It's guaranteed that Planner has not found
      another solution which has more apples or more oranges or even a better combination of both (such as 2 apples and
      3 oranges).</para>

      <para>To implement pareto scoring in Planner, <link linkend="customScore">implement a custom
      <literal>ScoreDefinition</literal> and <literal>Score</literal></link> (and replace the
      <literal>BestSolutionRecaller</literal>). Future versions will provide out-of-the-box support.</para>

      <note>
        <para>A pareto <literal>Score</literal>'s <literal>compareTo</literal> method is not transitive because it does
        a pareto comparison. For example: having 2 apples is greater than 1 apple. 1 apple is equal to 1 orange. Yet, 2 apples
        are not greater than 1 orange (but actually equal). Pareto comparison violates the contract of the interface
        <literal>java.lang.Comparable</literal>'s <literal>compareTo</literal> method, but Planner's systems are
        <emphasis>pareto comparison safe</emphasis>, unless explicitly stated otherwise in this documentation.</para>

      <para>The <literal>Score</literal> implementation to use depends on your use case. Your score might not
      efficiently fit in a single <literal>long</literal> value. Planner has several built-in <literal>Score</literal>

    <section xml:id="avoidFloatingPointNumbersInScoreCalculation">
      <title>Avoid Floating Point Numbers in Score Calculation</title>

      <para>Avoid the use of <literal>float</literal> and <literal>double</literal> for score calculation. Use
      <literal>BigDecimal</literal> instead.</para>

      <para>Floating point numbers (<literal>float</literal> and <literal>double</literal>) cannot represent a decimal
      number correctly. For example: a <literal>double</literal> cannot hold the value <literal>0.05</literal>
      correctly. Instead, it holds the nearest representable value. Arithmetic (including addition and subtraction) with
      floating point numbers, especially for planning problems, leads to incorrect decisions:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/scoreWeightType.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Additionally, floating point number addition is not associative:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">System.out.println( ((0.01 + 0.02) + 0.03) == (0.01 + (0.02 + 0.03)) ); // returns false</programlisting>

      <para>This leads to <emphasis>score corruption</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Decimal numbers (<literal>BigDecimal</literal>) have none of these problems.</para>

      <note>
        <para>BigDecimal arithmetic is considerably slower than <literal>int</literal>, <literal>long</literal> or
        <literal>double</literal> arithmetic. In experiments we've seen the average calculation count get divided by
        5.</para>

        <para>Therefore, in some cases, it can be worthwhile to multiply <emphasis>all</emphasis> numbers for a single
        score weight by a plural of ten (for example <literal>1000</literal>), so the score weight fits in an

        (A, B) and not for (B, A), (A, A) or (B, B). Let's take a closer look at this score rule on this solution of 4
        queens:</para>

        <para>In this solution the multipleQueensHorizontal score rule will fire for 6 queen couples: (A, B), (A, C),
        (A, D), (B, C), (B, D) and (C, D). Because none of the queens are on the same vertical or diagonal line, this
        solution will have a score of <literal>-6</literal>. An optimal solution of 4 queens has a score of
        <literal>0</literal>.</para>

      <para>The <literal>Solver</literal> will normally spend most of its execution time running the score calculation

      the same algorithm, which normally means a better solution in equal time.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="averageCalculationCountPerSecond">
      <title>Average Calculation Count Per Second</title>

      <para>After solving a problem, the <literal>Solver</literal> will log the <emphasis>average calculation count per
      second</emphasis>. This is a good measurement of Score calculation performance, despite that it is affected by non
      score calculation execution time. It depends on the problem scale of the problem dataset. Normally, even for high
      scale problems, it is higher than <literal>1000</literal>, except when you're using
      <literal>EasyScoreCalculator</literal>.</para>

      <important>
        <para>When improving your score calculation, focus on maximizing the average calculation count per second,
        instead of maximizing the best score. A big improvement in score calculation can sometimes yield little or no
        best score improvement, for example when the algorithm is stuck in a local or global optima. If you're watching
        the calculation count instead, score calculation improvements are far more visible.</para>

        <para>Furthermore, watching the calculation count, allows you to remove or add score constraints, and still
        compare it with the original calculation count. Comparing the best score with the original would be wrong,
        because it's comparing apples and oranges.</para>

      <para>Do not call remote services in your score calculation (except if you're bridging

      performance. Cache the results of those remote services if possible.</para>

    <section xml:id="pointlessConstraints">
      <title>Pointless Constraints</title>

      <para>If you know a certain constraint can never be broken (or it is always broken), don't bother writing a score
      constraint for it. For example in n queens, the score calculation doesn't check if multiple queens occupy the same
      column, because a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>column</literal> never changes and every
      <literal>Solution</literal> starts with each <literal>Queen</literal> on a different
      <literal>column</literal>.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Don't go overboard with this. If some datasets don't use a specific constraint but others do, just return
        out of the constraint as soon as you can. There is no need to dynamically change your score calculation based on

    <section xml:id="buildInHardConstraint">
      <title>Built-in Hard Constraint</title>

      <para>Instead of implementing a hard constraint, you can sometimes make it built-in too. For example: If
      <literal>Lecture</literal> A should never be assigned to <literal>Room</literal> X, but it uses ValueRangeProvider
      on Solution, the <literal>Solver</literal> will often try to assign it to <literal>Room</literal> X too (only to
      find out that it breaks a hard constraint). Use <link linkend="filteredSelection">filtered selection</link> to
      define that Course A should only be assigned a <literal>Room</literal> other than X.</para>

      <para>This tends to give a good performance gain, not just because the score calculation is faster, but mainly
      because most optimization algorithms will spend less time evaluating unfeasible solutions.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Don't go overboard with this. Many optimization algorithms rely on the freedom to break hard constraints
        when changing planning entities, to get out of local optima. There is a real risk of trading short term benefits

    </section>

    <section xml:id="scoreTrap">
      <title>Score Trap</title>

      <para>Make sure that none of your score constraints cause a score trap. A trapped score constraint uses the same
      weight for different constraint matches, when it could just as easily use a different weight. It effectively lumps
      its constraint matches together, which creates a flatlined score function for that constraint. This can cause a
      solution state in which several moves need to be done to resolve or lower the weight of that single constraint.
      Some examples of score traps:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you need 2 doctors at each table, but you're only moving 1 doctor at a time. So the solver has no
          incentive to move a doctor to a table with no doctors. Punish a table with no doctors more then a table with
          only 1 doctor in that score constraint in the score function.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>2 exams need to be conducted at the same time, but you're only moving 1 exam at a time. So the solver has
          to move one of those exams to another timeslot without moving the other in the same move. Add a
          coarse-grained move that moves both exams at the same time.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For example, consider this score trap. If the blue item moves from an overloaded computer to an empty
      computer, the hard score should improve. The trapped score implementation fails to do that:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/scoreTrap.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The Solver should eventually get out of this trap, but it will take a lot of effort (especially if there are
      even more processes on the overloaded computer). Before they do that, they might actually start moving more
      processes into that overloaded computer, as there is no penalty for doing so.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Avoiding score traps does not mean that your score function should be smart enough to avoid local optima.
        Leave it to the optimization algorithms to deal with the local optima.</para>

        <para>Avoiding score traps means to avoid - for each score constraint individually - a flatlined score
        function.</para>
      </note>

      <important>
        <para>Always specify the degree of infeasibility. The business will often say: "if the solution is infeasible,
        it doesn't matter how infeasible it." While that's true for the business, it's not true for score calculation:
        it benefits from knowing how infeasible it is. In practice, soft constraints usually do this naturally and it's
        just a matter of doing it for the hard constraints too.</para>
      </important>

      <para>There are several ways to deal with a score trap:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Improve the score constraint to make a distinction in the score weight. For example: penalize
          <literal>-1hard</literal> for every missing CPU, instead of just <literal>-1hard</literal> if any CPU is
          missing.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If changing the score constraint is not allowed from the business perspective, add a lower score level
          with a score constraint that makes such a distinction. For example: penalize <literal>-1subsoft</literal> for
          every missing CPU, on top of <literal>-1hard</literal> if any CPU is missing. The business ignores the subsoft
          score level.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Add coarse-grained moves and union select them with the existing fine-grained moves. A coarse-grained
          move effectively does multiple moves to directly get out of a score trap with a single move. For example: move
          multiple items from the same container to another container.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="stepLimitBenchmark">
      <title>stepLimit Benchmark</title>

      <para>Not all score constraints have the same performance cost. Sometimes 1 score constraint can kill the score
      calculation performance outright. Use the <link linkend="benchmarker">Benchmarker</link> to do a 1
      minute run and check what happens to the average calculation count per second if you comment out all but 1 of the
      score constraints.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="fairnessScoreConstraints">
      <title>Fairness Score Constraints</title>

      <para>Some use cases have a business requirement to provide a fair schedule (usually as a soft score constraint),
      for example:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Fairly distribute the workload amongst the employees, to avoid envy.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Evenly distribute the workload amongst assets, to improve reliability.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Implementing such a constraint can seem difficult (especially because there are different ways to formalize
      fairness), but usually the <emphasis>squared workload</emphasis> implementation behaves most desirable: for each
      employee/asset, count the workload <literal>w</literal> and subtract the square <literal>w²</literal> from the
      score.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Score_calculation/fairnessScoreConstraints.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>As shown above, the <emphasis>squared workload</emphasis> implementation guarantees that if you select 2
      employees from a given solution and make their distribution between those 2 employees fairer, then the resulting
      new solution will have a better overall score.</para>
