    <title>Examples Overview</title>

    <para>Planner has several examples. In this manual we explain mainly using the n queens example and cloud balancing

    <para>The source code of all these examples is available in the distribution zip under
    <filename>examples/sources</filename> and also in git under
    <filename>optaplanner/optaplanner-examples</filename>.</para>

        <para>Place n queens on a n sized chessboard so no 2 queens can attack each other. The most common n queens
        puzzle is the 8 queens puzzle, with <emphasis>n = 8</emphasis>:</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>No 2 queens can attack each other. A queen can attack any other queen on the same horizontal, vertical
            or diagonal line.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This documentation heavily uses the 4 queens puzzle as the primary example.</para>

        <para>A proposed solution could be:</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>The above solution is wrong because queens <literal>A1</literal> and <literal>B0</literal> can attack each
        other (so can queens <literal>B0</literal> and <literal>D0</literal>). Removing queen <literal>B0</literal>
        would respect the "no 2 queens can attack each other" constraint, but would break the "place n queens"
        constraint.</para>

        <para>Below is a correct solution:</para>

          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>All the constraints have been met, so the solution is correct. Note that most n queens puzzles have
        multiple correct solutions. We'll focus on finding a single correct solution for a given n, not on finding the
        number of possible correct solutions for a given n.</para>

        <para>Use a good domain model: it will be easier to understand and solve your planning problem. This is the

    private Column column;
    private Row row;

    public int getAscendingDiagonalIndex() {...}
    public int getDescendingDiagonalIndex() {...}

        <para>A <literal>Queen</literal> instance has a <literal>Column</literal> (for example: 0 is column A, 1 is
        column B, ...) and a <literal>Row</literal> (its row, for example: 0 is row 0, 1 is row 1, ...). Based on the
        column and the row, the ascending diagonal line as well as the descending diagonal line can be calculated. The
        column and row indexes start from the upper left corner of the chessboard.</para>

        <para>Assign each process to a machine. All processes already have an original (unoptimized) assignment. Each
        process requires an amount of each resource (such as CPU, RAM, ...). This is a more complex version of the Cloud

        <para>The vehicle routing with timewindows domain model makes heavily use of <link
        linkend="shadowVariable">shadow variables</link>. This allows it to express its constraints more naturally,
        because properties such as <literal>arrivalTime</literal> and <literal>departureTime</literal>, are directly
        available on the domain model.</para>

        <title>Road Distances Instead of Air Distances</title>

        <para>In the real world, vehicles can't follow a straight line from location to location: they have to use roads
        and highways. From a business point of view, this matters a lot:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Use_cases_and_examples/vehicleRoutingDistanceType.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>For the optimization algorithm, this doesn't matter much, as long as the distance between 2 points can be
        looked up (and are preferably precalculated). The road cost doesn't even need to be a distance, it can also be
        travel time, fuel cost, or a weighted function of those. There are several technologies available to
        precalculate road costs, such as <link xlink:href="https://graphhopper.com/">GraphHopper</link> (embeddable,
        offline Java engine), <link xlink:href="http://open.mapquestapi.com/directions/#matrix">Open MapQuest</link>
        (web service) and <link
        xlink:href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/webservices/client-library">Google Maps Client
        API</link> (web service).</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Use_cases_and_examples/integrationWithRealMaps.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>There are also several technologies to render it, such as <link
        xlink:href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</link> and <link
        xlink:href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps for developers</link>: the
        <literal>optaplanner-webexamples-*.war</literal> has an example which demonstrates such rendering:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Use_cases_and_examples/vehicleRoutingLeafletAndGoogleMaps.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>It's even possible to render the actual road routes with GraphHopper or Google Map Directions, but because
        of route overlaps on highways, it can become harder to see the standstill order:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/Chapter-Use_cases_and_examples/vehicleRoutingGoogleMapsDirections.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Take special care that the road costs between 2 points use the same optimization criteria as the one used
        in Planner. For example, GraphHopper etc will by default return the fastest route, not the shortest route. Don't
        use the km (or miles) distances of the fastest GPS routes to optimize the shortest trip in Planner: this leads
        to a suboptimal solution as shown below:</para>

        <mediaobject>
