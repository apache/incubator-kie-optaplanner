=== OptaPlanner 8.29.0.Final

==== Custom justifications and indictments in Constraint Streams

With a new Constraint Streams API, it is now easy to define custom constraint justifications and indictments in your constraints:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    protected Constraint vehicleCapacity(ConstraintFactory factory) {
        return factory.forEach(Customer.class)
                .filter(customer -> customer.getVehicle() != null)
                .groupBy(Customer::getVehicle, sum(Customer::getDemand))
                .filter((vehicle, demand) -> demand > vehicle.getCapacity())
                .penalizeLong(HardSoftLongScore.ONE_HARD,
                        (vehicle, demand) -> demand - vehicle.getCapacity())
                .justifyWith((vehicle, demand, score) ->
                    new VehicleDemandOveruse(vehicle, demand, score))
                .indictWith((vehicle, demand) -> List.of(vehicle))
                .asConstraint("vehicleCapacity");
    }
----

Note the new methods: `justifyWith(...)` and `indictWith(...)`. To find out more, see xref:constraint-streams/constraint-streams.adoc#constraintStreamsCustomizingJustificationsAndIndictments[customizing justifications and indictments].

==== Compatible with JDK 19

https://jdk.java.net/19/[OpenJDK 19] was recently released and OptaPlanner is fully compatible with it.

We always test our releases against the long-term supported versions of the JDK, currently 11 and 17, as well as against the latest release. We encourage you to upgrade your JDK regularly to benefit from the enhancements that come with the new releases.

==== New `@ShadowVariable` and `@PiggybackShadowVariable` annotations replace the `@CustomShadowVariable`

`@ShadowVariable` annotation is repeatable and allows to specify 1 listener per source variable.

`@PiggybackShadowVariable` is a specialized annotation to mark shadow variables that are updated by another shadow variable's listener.

The `@CustomShadowVariable` has been deprecated.

Read more about link:https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/shadow-variable/shadow-variable.html#customVariableListener[custom shadow variables] in the documentation.


[[releaseNotes-8.27.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.27.0.Final

==== Bavet is feature complete

The alternative constraint streams implementation Bavet is feature complete.
You can now use it as an alternative to Drools (which is still the default).

Bavet will not be supported in Red Hat's support offering.
Drools intends to catch up performance wise.


[[releaseNotes-8.24.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.24.0.Final

==== OptaWeb Employee Rostering demo application abandoned

The codebase for OptaWeb Employee Rostering demo application has been frozen and will no longer receive any updates.

We encourage users to check out the https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts/tree/stable/use-cases/employee-scheduling[OptaPlanner Employee Rostering Quickstart] for a simple and straight-forward way of integrating OptaPlanner in your application.


[[releaseNotes-8.23.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.23.0.Final

==== Score DRL deprecated in favor of Constraint Streams

Support for Score DRL has been deprecated and users are encouraged to migrate to https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/constraint-streams/constraint-streams.html[Constraint Streams] at their earliest convenience.
link:../upgradeRecipe/[Read the migration guide from score DRL to Constraint Streams].
Score DRL is not going away in OptaPlanner 8.


[[releaseNotes-8.20.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.20.0.Final

==== `SolverManager.addProblemChange()` now returns `CompletableFuture<Void>`

`SolverManager.addProblemChange()` returns `CompletableFuture<Void>`, which completes when a new best solution containing
the problem change has been passed to a user-defined `Consumer`.


[[releaseNotes-8.17.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.17.0.Final

==== Real-time planning available on the `SolverManager`

The `SolverManager` now accepts problem changes via the `addProblemChange()` method,
allowing for https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/repeated-planning/repeated-planning.html#realTimePlanning[real-time planning]
without much boilerplate code.

==== Faster `Solver` creation

`SolverFactory` newly caches some internal data structures, leading to much faster `Solver` creation times.
This is beneficial if you instantiate multiple `Solver` instances in quick succession.


[[releaseNotes-8.12.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.12.0.Final

==== Documentation website

The latest final OptaPlanner documentation is now available on a new
https://www.optaplanner.org/docs[documentation website] built using https://antora.org[Antora].
The single-HTML and PDF documentation will continue to be published in the https://docs.optaplanner.org/[archive].

==== Monitoring Support

OptaPlanner now uses Micrometer to monitor key metrics such as active solver count, solve durations, and error count.


[[releaseNotes-8.10.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.10.0.Final

==== Support for Quarkus 2.0

OptaPlanner is now fully compatible with the recently released https://quarkus.io/quarkus2/[Quarkus 2.0].


[[releaseNotes-8.7.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.7.0.Final

==== OptaPlanner quickstarts repository

There is a new `quarkus-call-center` quickstart that shows https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#realTimePlanning[real-time planning] of incoming calls in a call center.

[[releaseNotes-8.5.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.5.0.Final

==== Mapping in Constraint Streams

The link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreams[Constraint Streams API] received a major new functionality.
You can now modify your streams using link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsMappingTuples[mapping functions].

==== Ready for OpenJDK 16

We have made some tweaks under the hood
so that your experience with the recently released link:https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/16/[OpenJDK 16] continues to be smooth.

==== Inject and Autowire ConstraintVerifier in Quarkus and Spring Boot

You can now link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsTestingQuarkus[inject the Constraint Verifier in Quarkus] and
link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsTestingSpringBoot[autowire the Constraint Verifier in Spring Boot], allowing
you to link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsTesting[test your constraint streams] more easily.

==== OptaWebs on Quarkus

OptaWeb Vehicle Routing and OptaWeb Employee Rostering have been migrated from Spring Boot to Quarkus.

Other noteworthy changes done during the migration to Quarkus:

* OptaWeb Vehicle Routing back end has a new RESTful API.
Client-server communication, that was previously done using WebSockets, now uses a combination of REST calls and Server-Sent Events.
* OptaWeb Employee Rostering now uses Constraint Streams instead of DRL for score calculation.

==== Faster Domain Accessors and Cloning with Gizmo

We have added link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#domainAccess[Gizmo generated domain accessors and solution
cloners], which offer better performance than the reflection based
domain accessors and solution cloners.

==== OptaPlanner quickstarts repository

There is a new `activemq-quarkus-school-timetabling` quickstart that shows how to integrate ActiveMQ with OptaPlanner to horizontally scale when solving multiple data sets.


[[releaseNotes-8.3.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.3.0.Final

==== Major performance improvements for Constraint Streams

The default implementation of the link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreams[Constraint Streams API]
has seen major performance improvements.
Use cases with tri and quad streams may experience order of magnitude speedups.
Use cases with link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors[grouping]
are likely to experience some speedups too, albeit comparatively smaller.

Kudos to the link:https://drools.org/[Drools] team for helping make this possible!

==== Constraint Streams `groupBy()` overloads for multiple collectors

The link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreams[Constraint Streams API]
has been extended to allow using more than 2 collectors in a single link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors[grouping].
The following is now possible:

[source,java]
----
return constraintFactory.from(ProductPrice.class)
    .groupBy(min(), max(), sum())
    .penalize(..., SimpleScore.ONE, (minPrice, maxPrice, sumPrices) -> ...);
----


[[releaseNotes-8.0.0.Final]]
=== OptaPlanner 8.0.0.Final

==== OptaPlanner quickstarts repository

The new https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts[OptaPlanner Quickstarts repository]
contains pretty web demos for several use cases.
It also shows you how to integrate OptaPlanner with different technologies:

* *School timetabling*: Assign lessons to timeslots and rooms to produce a better schedule for teachers and students.
+
This application connects to a relational database and exposes a REST API, rendered by a pretty JavaScript UI.
+
** `quarkus-school-timetabling`: Java, Maven or Gradle, Quarkus, H2
** `spring-boot-school-timetabling`: Java, Maven or Gradle, Spring Boot, H2
** `kotlin-quarkus-school-timetabling`: Kotlin, Maven, Quarkus, H2
* *Facility location problem (FLP)*: Pick the best geographical locations for new stores, distribution centers, COVID-19 test centers or telco masts.

==== Future Java compatibility

The OptaPlanner 8 API has been groomed to maximize compatibility
with the latest https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK] and https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] releases
and game-changing platforms such as https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus].
Meanwhile, we still fully support OpenJDK 11 and platforms such as Spring Boot or plain Java.

For example, when running OptaPlanner in Java 11 or higher with a classpath,
OptaPlanner no longer triggers `WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred`
for XStream.

==== Code completion for solverConfig.xml and benchmarkConfig.xml through XSD

To validate XML configuration during development,
add the new XML Schema Definition (XSD) on the solver or benchmark configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  ...
</solver>
----

This enables code completion for XML in most IDEs:

image:release-notes/solverConfigCompletion.png[SolverConfigCodeCompletion]

==== Improved Quarkus extension

The OptaPlanner Quarkus extension is now stable
and displays no warnings when compiling Java to a native executable.

==== ScoreManager now supports score explanation

The `ScoreManager` can now also explain why a solution has a certain score:

[source,java]
----
ScoreManager<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(solverFactory);
...
ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> scoreExplanation = scoreManager.explain(timeTable);
System.out.println(scoreExplanation.getSummary());
...
----

Additionally, use `scoreExplanation.getConstraintMatchTotalMap()` and `scoreExplanation.getIndictmentMap()`
to extract the `ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftScore>` and `Indictment<HardSoftScore>` information without triggering a new score calculation.

==== Various improvements

* The ConstraintStreams API is now richer, more stable with better error messages and faster.
* The `SolverManager` API now supports to listen to both best solution events and the solving ended event.
* OptaPlanner no longer depends on Guava or Reflections.
