Hard constraints:

* *No unassigned shifts* (built-in): Every shift need to be assigned to an employee.
* **Shift conflict**: An employee can have only one shift per day.

Soft constraints:

* Contract obligations. The business frequently violates these, so they decided to define these as soft constraints instead of hard constraints.
** **Minimum and maximum assignments**: Each employee needs to work more than x shifts and less than y shifts (depending on their contract).
** **Minimum and maximum consecutive working days**: Each employee needs to work between x and y days in a row (depending on their contract).
** **Minimum and maximum consecutive free days**: Each employee needs to be free between x and y days in a row (depending on their contract).
** **Minimum and maximum consecutive working weekends**: Each employee needs to work between x and y weekends in a row (depending on their contract).
** **Complete weekends**: Each employee needs to work every day in a weekend or not at all.
** **Identical shift types during weekend**: Each weekend shift for the same weekend of the same employee must be the same shift type.
** **Unwanted patterns**: A combination of unwanted shift types in a row. For example: a late shift followed by an early shift followed by a late shift.
* Employee wishes:
** **Day on request**: An employee wants to work on a specific day.
** **Day off request**: An employee does not want to work on a specific day.
** **Shift on request**: An employee wants to be assigned to a specific shift.
** **Shift off request**: An employee does not want to be assigned to a specific shift.
* **Alternative skill**: An employee assigned to a shift should have a proficiency in every skill required by that shift.
