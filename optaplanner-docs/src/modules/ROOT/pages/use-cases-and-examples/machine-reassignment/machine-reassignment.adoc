[[machineReassignmentProblemDescription]]
== Problem description

Assign each process to a machine.
All processes already have an original (unoptimized) assignment.
Each process requires an amount of each resource (such as CPU, RAM, ...). This is a more complex version of the Cloud Balancing example.

Hard constraints:

* Maximum capacity: The maximum capacity for each resource for each machine must not be exceeded.
* Conflict: Processes of the same service must run on distinct machines.
* Spread: Processes of the same service must be spread out across locations.
* Dependency: The processes of a service depending on another service must run in the neighborhood of a process of the other service.
* Transient usage: Some resources are transient and count towards the maximum capacity of both the original machine as the newly assigned machine.

Soft constraints:

* Load: The safety capacity for each resource for each machine should not be exceeded.
* Balance: Leave room for future assignments by balancing the available resources on each machine.
* Process move cost: A process has a move cost.
* Service move cost: A service has a move cost.
* Machine move cost: Moving a process from machine A to machine B has another A-B specific move cost.
