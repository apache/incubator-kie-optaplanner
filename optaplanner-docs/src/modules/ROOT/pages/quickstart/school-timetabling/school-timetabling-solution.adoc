= Gather the domain objects in a planning solution
:imagesdir: ../..

A `TimeTable` wraps all `Timeslot`, `Room`, and `Lesson` instances of a single dataset.
Furthermore, because it contains all lessons, each with a specific planning variable state,
it is a _planning solution_ and it has a score:

* If lessons are still unassigned, then it is an _uninitialized_ solution,
for example, a solution with the score `-4init/0hard/0soft`.
* If it breaks hard constraints, then it is an _infeasible_ solution,
for example, a solution with the score `-2hard/-3soft`.
* If it adheres to all hard constraints, then it is a _feasible_ solution,
for example, a solution with the score `0hard/-7soft`.

Create the `src/main/java/org/acme/schooltimetabling/domain/TimeTable.java` class:

The `TimeTable` class has an `@PlanningSolution` annotation,
so OptaPlanner knows that this class contains all of the input and output data.

Specifically, this class is the input of the problem:

* A `timeslotList` field with all time slots
** This is a list of problem facts, because they do not change during solving.
* A `roomList` field with all rooms
** This is a list of problem facts, because they do not change during solving.
* A `lessonList` field with all lessons
** This is a list of planning entities, because they change during solving.
** Of each `Lesson`:
*** The values of the `timeslot` and `room` fields are typically still `null`, so unassigned.
They are planning variables.
*** The other fields, such as `subject`, `teacher` and `studentGroup`, are filled in.
These fields are problem properties.

However, this class is also the output of the solution:

* A `lessonList` field for which each `Lesson` instance has non-null `timeslot` and `room` fields after solving
* A `score` field that represents the quality of the output solution, for example, `0hard/-5soft`

== The value range providers

The `timeslotList` field is a value range provider.
It holds the `Timeslot` instances which OptaPlanner can pick from to assign to the `timeslot` field of `Lesson` instances.
The `timeslotList` field has an `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation to connect the `@PlanningVariable` with the `@ValueRangeProvider`,
by matching the type of the planning variable with the type returned by the xref:planner-configuration/planner-configuration.adoc#planningValueRangeProvider[value range provider].

Following the same logic, the `roomList` field also has an `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation.

== The problem fact and planning entity properties

Furthermore, OptaPlanner needs to know which `Lesson` instances it can change
as well as how to retrieve the `Timeslot` and `Room` instances used for score calculation
by your `TimeTableConstraintProvider`.

The `timeslotList` and `roomList` fields have an `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation,
so your `TimeTableConstraintProvider` can select _from_ those instances.

The `lessonList` has an `@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty` annotation,
so OptaPlanner can change them during solving
and your `TimeTableConstraintProvider` can select _from_ those too.
