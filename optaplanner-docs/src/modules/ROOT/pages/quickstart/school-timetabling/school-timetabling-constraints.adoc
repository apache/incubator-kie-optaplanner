= Define the constraints and calculate the score
:imagesdir: ../..

A _score_ represents the quality of a specific solution.
The higher the better.
OptaPlanner looks for the best solution, which is the solution with the highest score found in the available time.
It might be the _optimal_ solution.

Because this use case has hard and soft constraints,
use the `HardSoftScore` class to represent the score:

* Hard constraints must not be broken. For example: _A room can have at most one lesson at the same time._
* Soft constraints should not be broken. For example: _A teacher prefers to teach in a single room._

Hard constraints are weighted against other hard constraints.
Soft constraints are weighted too, against other soft constraints.
*Hard constraints always outweigh soft constraints*, regardless of their respective weights.

To calculate the score, you could implement an `EasyScoreCalculator` class:

[source,java]
----
public class TimeTableEasyScoreCalculator implements EasyScoreCalculator<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> {

    @Override
    public HardSoftScore calculateScore(TimeTable timeTable) {
        List<Lesson> lessonList = timeTable.getLessonList();
        int hardScore = 0;
        for (Lesson a : lessonList) {
            for (Lesson b : lessonList) {
                if (a.getTimeslot() != null && a.getTimeslot().equals(b.getTimeslot())
                        && a.getId() < b.getId()) {
                    // A room can accommodate at most one lesson at the same time.
                    if (a.getRoom() != null && a.getRoom().equals(b.getRoom())) {
                        hardScore--;
                    }
                    // A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.
                    if (a.getTeacher().equals(b.getTeacher())) {
                        hardScore--;
                    }
                    // A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.
                    if (a.getStudentGroup().equals(b.getStudentGroup())) {
                        hardScore--;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        int softScore = 0;
        // Soft constraints are only implemented in the optaplanner-quickstarts code
        return HardSoftScore.of(hardScore, softScore);
    }

}

Unfortunately **that does not scale well**, because it is non-incremental:
every time a lesson is assigned to a different time slot or room,
all lessons are re-evaluated to calculate the new score.

Instead, create a `src/main/java/org/acme/schooltimetabling/solver/TimeTableConstraintProvider.java` class
to perform incremental score calculation.
It uses OptaPlanner's ConstraintStream API which is inspired by Java Streams and SQL:

The `ConstraintProvider` scales an order of magnitude better than the `EasyScoreCalculator`: __O__(n) instead of __O__(nÂ²).
