[[hyperheuristicsOverview]]
== Overview

A hyperheuristic automates the decision which heuristic(s) to use on a specific data set.

A future version of OptaPlanner will have native support for hyperheuristics.
Meanwhile, it's possible to implement it yourself: Based on the size or difficulty of a data set (which is a criterion), use a different `Solver` configuration (or adjust the default configuration using the Solver configuration API). The <<benchmarker,Benchmarker>> can help to identify such criteria.
