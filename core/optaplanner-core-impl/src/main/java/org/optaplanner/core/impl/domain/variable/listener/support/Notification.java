/**
 * A notification represents some kind of change of a planning variable. When a score director is notified about a change,
 * one notification is created for each {@link Notifiable} registered for the subject of the change.
 * <p/>
 * Each implementation is tailored to a specific {@link AbstractVariableListener} and triggers on the listener
 * the pair of "before/after" methods corresponding to the type of change it represents.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if there is a shadow variable sourced on the {@code Process.computer} genuine planning variable,
 * then there is a notifiable {@code F} registered for the {@code Process.computer} planning variable, and it holds a basic
 * variable listener {@code L}.
 * When {@code Process X} is moved from {@code Computer A} to {@code Computer B}, a notification {@code N} is created and added
 * to notifiable {@code F}'s queue. The notification {@code N} triggers
 * {@link VariableListener#beforeVariableChanged L.beforeVariableChanged(scoreDirector, Process X)} immediately.
 * Later, when {@link Notifiable#triggerAllNotifications() F.triggerAllNotifications()} is called, {@code N} is taken from
 * the queue and triggers {@link VariableListener#afterVariableChanged}.
 *
 * @param <Solution_> the solution type, the class with the {@link PlanningSolution} annotation
 * @param <T> the variable listener type
