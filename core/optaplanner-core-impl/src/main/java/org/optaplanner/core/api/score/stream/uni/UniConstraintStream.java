    /**
     * Transforms the stream in such a way that tuples are remapped using the given function.
     * This may produce a stream with duplicate tuples.
     * See {@link #distinct()} for details.
     * <p>
     * There are several recommendations for implementing the mapping function:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Purity.
     * The mapping function should only depend on its input.
     * That is, given the same input, it always returns the same output.</li>
     * <li>Bijectivity.
     * No two input tuples should map to the same output tuple,
     * or to tuples that are {@link Object#equals(Object) equal}.
     * Not following this recommendation creates a constraint stream with duplicate tuples,
     * and may force you to use {@link #distinct()} later, which comes with a performance cost.</li>
     * <li>Immutable data carriers.
     * The objects returned by the mapping function should be identified by their contents and nothing else.
     * If two of them have contents which {@link Object#equals(Object) equal},
     * then they should likewise {@link Object#equals(Object) equal} and preferably be the same instance.
     * The objects returned by the mapping function should also be immutable,
     * meaning their contents should not be allowed to change.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * Simple example: assuming a constraint stream of tuples of {@code Person}s
     * {@code [Ann(age = 20), Beth(age = 25), Cathy(age = 30)]},
     * calling {@code map(Person::getAge)} on such stream will produce a stream of {@link Integer}s
     * {@code [20, 25, 30]},
     *
     * <p>
     * Example with a non-bijective mapping function: assuming a constraint stream of tuples of {@code Person}s
     * {@code [Ann(age = 20), Beth(age = 25), Cathy(age = 30), David(age = 30), Eric(age = 20)]},
     * calling {@code map(Person::getAge)} on such stream will produce a stream of {@link Integer}s
     * {@code [20, 25, 30, 30, 20]}.
     *
     * @param mapping never null, function to convert the original tuple into the new tuple

     * <p>
