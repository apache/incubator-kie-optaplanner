/**
 * Instances of {@link PatternDef} are mutable and as such can not be reused by constraint streams that could
 * result in mutually different rules.
 * However, multiple rules can be based on the same constraint streams through stream sharing.
 * This class makes it nearly impossible for {@link PatternDef}s to be unknowingly shared.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are immutable.
 * Mutating methods (such as {@link #expand(UnaryOperator)}) create a new instance, effectively preventing
 * streams from sharing patterns.
 * Patterns are only built when {@link #build()} or {@link #build(DeclarationSource)} is called. Callers must ensure
 * that {@link PatternDef}s obtained by these methods are never mutated, as that defeats the purpose.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Stream 1 joins A and B.
 * Stream 2 filters Stream 1.
 * Stream 3 also filters Stream 1, but with a different filter.
 * If the pattern inside Stream 1 was shared by Stream 2 and Stream 3, filters from Stream 2 would also apply to
 * Stream 3, and vice versa.
 * Therefore, Stream 2 and Stream 3 each get their own immutable copy of Stream 1's {@link DroolsPatternBuilder}, one
 * which only applies their individual filters.
 *
 * @param <T> generic type of the pattern to be eventually created by this builder
