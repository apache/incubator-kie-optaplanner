/**
 * A constraint stream is a declaration on how to match {@link UniConstraintStream one}, {@link BiConstraintStream two}
 * or more objects.
 * Constraint streams are similar to a declaration of a JDK {@link Stream} or an SQL query,
 * but they support incremental score calculation
 * and {@link ScoreDirector#getConstraintMatchTotalMap()} score justification}.
 * <p>
 * An object that passes through constraint streams is called a fact.
 * It's either a {@link ProblemFactCollectionProperty problem fact} or a {@link PlanningEntity planning entity}.
 * <p>
 * A constraint stream is typically created with {@link ConstraintFactory#from(Class)}
 * or {@link UniConstraintStream#join(UniConstraintStream, BiJoiner)} by joining another constraint stream}.
 * Constraint streams form a directed, non-cyclic graph, with multiple start nodes (which listen to fact changes)
 * and one end node per {@link Constraint} (which affect the {@link Score}).
 * <p>
 * Throughout this documentation, we will be using the following terminology:
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Constraint Stream</dt>
 * <dd>A chain of different operations, originated by {@link ConstraintFactory#from(Class)} (or similar
 * methods) and terminated by a penalization or reward operation.</dd>
 * <dt>Operation</dt>
 * <dd>Operations (implementations of {@link ConstraintStream}) are parts of a constraint stream which mutate
 * it.
 * They may remove tuples from further evaluation, expand or contract streams. Every constraint stream has
 * a terminal operation, which is either a penalization or a reward.</dd>
 * <dt>Fact</dt>
 * <dd>Object instance entering the constraint stream.</dd>
 * <dt>Genuine Fact</dt>
 * <dd>Fact that enters the constraint stream either through a from(...) call or through a join(...) call.
 * Genuine facts are either planning entities (see {@link PlanningEntity}) or problem facts (see
 * {@link ProblemFactProperty} or {@link ProblemFactCollectionProperty}).</dd>
 * <dt>Inferred Fact</dt>
 * <dd>Fact that enters the constraint stream through a computation.
 * This would typically happen through an operation such as groupBy(...).</dd>
 * <dt>Tuple</dt>
 * <dd>A collection of facts that the constraint stream operates on, propagating them from operation to
 * operation.
 * For example, {@link UniConstraintStream} operates on single-fact tuples {A} and {@link BiConstraintStream}
 * operates on two-fact tuples {A, B}.
 * Putting facts into a tuple implies a relationship exists between these facts.</dd>
 * <dt>Match</dt>
 * <dd>Match is a tuple that reached the terminal operation of a constraint stream and is therefore either
 * penalized or rewarded.</dd>
 * <dt>Cardinality</dt>
 * <dd>The number of facts in a tuple. Uni constraint streams have a cardinality of 1, bi constraint streams
 * have a cardinality of 2, etc.</dd>
 * <dt>Conversion</dt>
 * <dd>An operation that changes the cardinality of a constraint stream.
 * This typically happens through join(...) or a groupBy(...) operations.</dd>
 * </dl>
