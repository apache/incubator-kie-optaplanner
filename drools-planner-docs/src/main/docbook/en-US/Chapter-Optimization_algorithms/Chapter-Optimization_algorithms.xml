  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>In number of possible solutions for a planning problem can be mind blowing. For example:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>4 queens has 256 possible solutions (<literal>n ^ n</literal>) and 2 optimal solutions.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>5 queens has 3125 possible solutions (<literal>n ^ n</literal>) and 1 optimal solution.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>8 queens has 16777216 possible solutions (<literal>n ^ n</literal>) and 92 optimal solutions.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Most real-life planning problems have an incredible number of possible solutions and only 1 or a few
        optimal solutions.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>An optimization algorithm that checks every possible solution (even with pruning) can easily run for billions
    of years on a single real-life planning problem. Most of the time, we are happy with a feasible solution found in a
    limited amount of time.</para>

    <para>The combination of Drools Planner's optimization algorithms and the Drools Expert rule engine turn out to be a
    very efficient, because:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A rule engine such as Drools Expert is <emphasis role="bold">great for calculating the score</emphasis> of
        a solution of a planning problem. It make it easy and scalable to add additional soft or hard constraints such
        as "a teacher shouldn't teach more then 7 hours a day". It does delta based score calculation without any extra
        code. However it tends to be not suited to use to actually find new solutions.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>An optimization algorithm is <emphasis role="bold">great at finding new improving solutions</emphasis> for
        a planning problem, without necessarily brute-forcing every possibility. However it needs to know the score of a
        solution and offers no support in calculating that score efficiently.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Drools Planner's implementation combines both. On top of that, it also offers additional support for
    benchmarking, etc.</para>

    <title><literal>SolverPhase</literal></title>

    <para>A <literal>Solver</literal> can use multiple optimization algorithms in sequence. <emphasis role="bold">Each
    optimization algorithm is represented by a <literal>SolverPhase</literal>.</emphasis> There is never more than 1
    <literal>SolverPhase</literal> solving at the same time.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Some <literal>SolverPhase</literal> implementations can combine techniques from multiple optimization
      algorithms, but they are still just 1 <literal>SolverPhase</literal>. For example: a local search
      <literal>SolverPhase</literal> can do simulated annealing with property tabu.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Here's a configuration that runs 3 phases in sequence:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;solver&gt;
  ...
  &lt;customSolverPhase&gt;&lt;!-- Phase 1 --&gt;
    ... &lt;!-- custom construction heuristic --&gt;
  &lt;/customSolverPhase&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;&lt;!-- Phase 2 --&gt;
    ... &lt;!-- simulated annealing --&gt;
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;&lt;!-- Phase 3 --&gt;
    ... &lt;!-- Tabu search --&gt;
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>When the first phase terminates, the second phase starts, and so on. When the last phase terminates, the
    <literal>Solver</literal> terminates.</para>

    <para>Some phases (especially construction heuristics) will terminate automatically. Other phases (especially
    metaheuristics) will only terminate if the phase is configured to terminate:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;solver&gt;
  ...
  &lt;termination&gt;&lt;!-- Solver termination --&gt;
    &lt;maximumSecondsSpend&gt;90&lt;/maximumSecondsSpend&gt;
  &lt;/termination&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    &lt;termination&gt;&lt;!-- Phase termination --&gt;
      &lt;maximumSecondsSpend&gt;60&lt;/maximumSecondsSpend&gt;&lt;!-- Let the next phase run too, before the solver terminates --&gt;
    &lt;/termination&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>If the <literal>Solver</literal> terminates (before the last phase terminates itself), the current phase is
    terminated and all subsequent phases won't run.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Which optimization algorithms should I use?</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>best</emphasis> optimization algorithms configuration for your use case depends heavily on your
    use case. Nevertheless, this vanilla recipe will get you into the game with a pretty good configuration, probably
    much better than what you're used to.</para>

    <para>Start with a quick configuration like this as this involves little or no code:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>First Fit</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Next, implement planning entity difficulty comparison and turn it into:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>First Fit Decreasing</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Next, implement moves and add tabu search:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>First Fit Decreasing</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Tabu search (use property tabu 5 or move tabu 7)</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>At this point <emphasis>the free lunch is over</emphasis>. The result is probably more than good enough, but
    we can do better. Use the Benchmarker and try a couple of simulated annealing configurations:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>First Fit Decreasing</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Simulated annealing (try several starting temperatures)</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>And try this too:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>First Fit Decreasing</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Simulated annealing (relatively long time)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Tabu search (relatively short time)</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Custom SolverPhase</title>

    <para>Between phases or before the first phase, you might want to execute a custom action on the
    <literal>Solution</literal> to get a better score. Yet you'll still want to reuse the score calculation. For
    example, to implement a custom construction heuristic without implementing an entire
    <literal>SolverPhase</literal>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Most of the time, a custom construction heuristic is not worth the hassle. The supported constructions
      heuristics are configurable (so you can tweak them with the benchmarker), <literal>Termination</literal> aware and
      support partially initialized solutions too.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Implement the <literal>CustomSolverPhaseCommand</literal> interface :</para>

    <programlisting>public interface CustomSolverPhaseCommand {

    void changeWorkingSolution(SolutionDirector solutionDirector);

}</programlisting>

    <para>For example:</para>

    <programlisting>public class ExaminationStartingSolutionInitializer implements CustomSolverPhaseCommand {

    public void changeWorkingSolution(SolutionDirector solutionDirector) {
        Examination examination = (Examination) solutionDirector.getWorkingSolution();
        for (Exam exam : examination.getExamList()) {
            Score unscheduledScore = solutionDirector.calculateScoreFromWorkingMemory();
            ...
            for (Period period : examination.getPeriodList()) {
                exam.setPeriod(period)
                workingMemory.update(examHandle, exam);
                Score score = solutionDirector.calculateScoreFromWorkingMemory();
                ...
            }
            ...
        }
    }

}</programlisting>

    <warning>
      <para>Any change on the planning entities in a <literal>CustomSolverPhaseCommand</literal> must be told to the
      <literal>WorkingMemory</literal> of <literal>solutionDirector.getWorkingMemory()</literal>.</para>
    </warning>

    <warning>
      <para>Do not change any of the planning facts in a <literal>CustomSolverPhaseCommand</literal>. That will corrupt
      the <literal>Solver</literal> because any previous score or solution was for a different problem. If you want to
      do that, see the section about Real-time planning instead.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>And configure it like this:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;solver&gt;
  ...
  &lt;customSolverPhase&gt;
    &lt;customSolverPhaseCommandClass&gt;org.drools.planner.examples.examination.solver.solution.initializer.ExaminationStartingSolutionInitializer&lt;/customSolverPhaseCommandClass&gt;
  &lt;/customSolverPhase&gt;
  ... &lt;!-- Other phases --&gt;
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>It's possible to configure multiple <literal>customSolverPhaseCommandClass</literal> instances, which will be
    run in sequence.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If the changes of a <literal>CustomSolverPhaseCommand</literal> don't result in a better score, the best
      solution won't be changed (so effectively nothing will have changed for the next <literal>SolverPhase</literal> or
      <literal>CustomSolverPhaseCommand</literal>). TODO: we might want to change this behaviour?</para>
    </note>

    <note>
      <para>If the <literal>Solver</literal> or <literal>SolverPhase</literal> wants to terminate while a
      <literal>CustomSolverPhaseCommand</literal> is still running, it will wait to terminate until the
      <literal>CustomSolverPhaseCommand</literal> is done. </para>
